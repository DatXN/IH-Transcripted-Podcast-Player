        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            On this show I talk to the founders of profitable Internet businesses and I try to get a sense of what it's
            to be in their shoes. How did they get to where they are today? How did they make decisions, both at their
            companies and in their personal lives and what makes their businesses tick?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Today I'm talking to Mike Taber. Mike is one of the co-creators of MicroConf. Probably the biggest and I
            think definitely the best conference for self-funded founders. Mike is also the co-host of the podcast
            Startups For the Rest of Us, which is a great show.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You should all check it out. And finally Mike is the founder of a company called Bluetick, which is what
            we're going to spend most of our time talking about today.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Mike, I'm glad to finally have you on here and thanks for joining.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So the company you're working on, Bluetick is what you'd call email
            follow-up software. The basic idea is that if you find yourself wasting time sending email after email to
            the same people. You sign up for Bluetick instead and it's super smart.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It'll send out follow-up emails on your behalf automatically and it knows exactly when to stop sending them
            and you can set it to send different emails every time, in a sequence.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Is that a good description of what the company does?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Great, I think it's a cool idea. It's something that I probably should
            have been using for IndieHackers because I send a ton of follow-up emails for the podcast to get guests
            yourself scheduled.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I send a ton of follow-up emails for the text interviews on the site, to remind people to finish their
            writing. And I think more importantly back when I was selling ads it took a ton of follow-up emails just to
            get sponsors to get me their ad copy and pay me etc.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Probably could have made more money if I had something Bluetick so I wouldn't forget to send follow-up
            emails every now and then. So Bluetick is entirely self funded. Is that right?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">To start with, before I started breaking code on it I think was 2015.
            It was just November or December was about the time I started going through the validation process for it
            and I did not break code until January or so of 2016 and then it took four or five months or so to get an
            actual thing that people could use.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It took another to eight months to get people to start using it and then at some point I drew a line in the
            sand and said, okay, you're gonna start paying for it because I'm taking pre-orders. After that, I basically
            just started onboarding new customers and I work on it full-time for the most part but it's not enough to
            make a full time living on.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I have around $1500 or so in recurring revenue. And then I've also got people who've paid for annual
            plans. It's somewhere north of that but it's probably not quite two thousand dollars a month if you were to
            aggregate it over the course of an entire year.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well yeah, I don't really want to make it some ginormous business but
            at the same time I want it to make enough money that I can use that revenue as a platform to do whatever I
            want and essentially buy my own time so that I can do anything. That way I can just go to sleep at night and
            if I want to take off two or three days or a week, I can just go do so.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And I just took a family vacation a couple of weeks ago and drove down to Virginia from Massachusetts,
            stopped at DC, stopped in Philly along the way. Went and did a bunch of different things. I answered a
            couple of emails, a couple of support things while I was gone and everything just kept running without me
            doing anything. Which is great to have that recurring revenue, I mean, I'm still getting the emails that say
            "hey, this credit card was just charged".</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's nice to see those things coming in and I see, I'll call it, a light at the end of the tunnel. Where at
            some point in the future there's enough customers where I don't have to worry about what other sources of
            revenue I have. And I can just, I don't want to say let the money roll in, it's misleading to say that in
            any business you're going to be able to get it to a point where it's passive income. That's just not going
            to, that's not the way to really phrase that. I think it's misleading to say every business could be turned
            into passive income.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That's a good question, am I effective? I am effective enough to be
            able to maintain everything running at the same time but there's a lot of things where I don't do nearly as
            much as it may appear on the surface. For example, when Rob and I first built the Startups For the Rest of
            Us podcast, him and I would alternate with the episodes, very similar when we were creating content for the
            Founder Cafe community. He'd do an episode and an outline then I would do one.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            At the same time we're also doing all of the editing for it. We would send out the transcripts because quite
            frankly that was just way too much effort so we would pay to have those done but we would do the audio
            editing ourselves and anyone who's done audio editing, you know that it takes probably about three times as
            much time as there is raw audio.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you have 60 minutes of raw audio, it's going to take you about 3 hours to edit regardless of what you
            edit it down to.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We ended up outsourcing that fairly early on, no later than the 10th or 15th episode I think. It was just
            too time consuming. At this point our process is really, one of us put together the outline, the other
            person gets on the call maybe five minutes before maybe five or ten minutes after the scheduled time and we
            record and it gets sent into Dropbox and that's it. we're hands off completely after that, we don't touch
            anything. My time for that is actually extremely but it looks I probably put a lot of work into it.</p>

            You were on the podcast once before and literally what you saw was probably about the extent of my
            involvement with it, aside from just writing the outline. Earlier today we did an episode and we created the

            What about everything else that you're working on Bluetick and MicroConf? How do you juggle those things

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So with MicroConf things are planned far enough in advance that most of
            the time, there is not much that goes on on a weekly basis. We also have Xander who helps out with a lot of
            logistical stuff, directly interacting with the hotels and vendors and things that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We have things split, so Rob handles the speakers for the most part. I handle the sponsors for the most part
            and I have my own process for dealing with the sponsors. He has his own process for dealing with the
            speakers but we don't really mix back and forth between them. My involvement in MicroConf tends to be mostly
            just on that sponsor side of things. It's a lot less work than it looks and plus I Bluetick to help me out
            with that.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so if I had to summarize your strategy, it's three things
            basically. Number one, work with a co-founder so you've got Rob helping you on the podcast and with the
            conference. You're not doing it all by yourself.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Number two, reduce the scope of everything you're doing down to the bare minimum and I think this is what
            most people struggle with and why most of us feel we don't have time. We envision these massive projects. We
            bite off way more than we can chew, when in reality it would be better off if we just did that small first
            ten or twenty percent and I think your podcast is a great example of this.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You just do the 20% of the work that gets you 80% of the results and you don't worry about the rest. Then
            number three is to outsource the rest and so you've got Xander doing events for you for MicroConf and you've
            got a transcriptionist and an editor for your podcast and all of this comes together to let you get more
            done in less time.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah especially when there's things that you need to do that you know
            take a lot of focus and mental energy. If you have to spend that time doing things that are complicated, for
            example writing code is generally something that you have to dedicate a lot of mental resources to, it's
            hard to alternate between that and then interrupting it with support emails and I've got to make this phone
            call or my kid's sick and I’ve got to take him to the doctor.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's really hard to flip flop back and forth between them or just the context switching will kill you. You
            just won't be able to get anything done. It's really about limiting the things that I need to do that

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don't feel I ever really wanted to become an employee of a business.
            I actually gave this quite a bit of thought a while ago and my earliest business was when I was probably 10
            or 11 years old and I made a couple of hundred dollars renting out my Nintendo video games to my friends.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I would just charge them a dollar a day and they'd take my video game and most of them would keep them for a
            couple of weeks because it was cheap enough that they could do that. And then they'd give them back to me
            and then I would get the money from them.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then I would use that money to go out and buy other video games that I thought that they were interested in,
            that I also wanted to buy or wanted to play and then I would just repeat the process. I had a nice little
            game business going when I was probably 11 years old.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I had a video game company that I wanted to build out. The goal was to
            not just publish my own video games but to also publish those of others. I had a friend, his name is Andrew
            Welch. He ran Ambrosia software for a long time.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            He still runs it to this day, but he runs a couple of other side businesses at this point. I grew up and
            went to the same college as he did. I looked up to him, this is somebody who, he actually went to college
            for photography but he had built up this shareware business while he was still in high school.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I looked at him and said, “Well he's doing these types of things, I'd love to be able to do that too.” The
            goal at the time was to be able to publish other people's games, basically become a video game publisher and
            build out the business and I never really quite figured out how to market them well enough.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            A lot of the games were built by other people, so it was very difficult for me to have creative control or
            help them with stuff early enough in the process just because I didn't have the money to be able to get
            involved that early or the connections or anything that and I was still extremely young at the time. So that
            business never really went too far.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We did have a game called Cry of the Ancients that was a web-based game, way before the Facebook games
            Farmville and Candy Crush and things that became popular. This was five, seven years before that, but I got
            it to the point where it had probably four or five hundred players who logged in pretty much every day to
            play the game.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'll say it was a moderate success but there was really no good revenue stream for it. Advertising only went
            so far, we were doing pay-per-click, inside there were banner ads stuff that, but it paid for server costs
            to some extent but probably not the whole thing.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, I thought about why and reasons that, that particular business
            didn't go as well. Part of it was just I didn't have the money to be able to interact with the people who
            were building better games to be honest. I just didn't have the money to be able to fund those types of
            things on my own.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            In terms of the Cry of the Ancients game, I think that could have definitely been monetized a lot better but
            one of the core things that I wanted to bring to it was, have a game that where you couldn't buy your way
            into a better position.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I hated playing games where you could basically pay money and become better than other players solely
            because you paid money for it. And I never wanted it to turn into that and had I gone in a different
            direction had I tried to really monetize it, I definitely think that the game could have been a much bigger
            thing than it was and I definitely think it could have been a money maker, but it was not something that I
            really focused on.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Those are the types of things that I did think about but it just went against what my vision for that
            particular game was.</p>

            full-time for a company called Clearwire Technologies out of Buffalo New York and then when I left there in

            but the company that acquired us was called Altiris.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            They acquired us, but then there was a lock on our stock options so we couldn't sell them for six months or
            something like that. And then by that time their stock price had dropped in half so I got way less money
            than I should have but oh well.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">From 2005 until five to seven years later I was doing a lot of
            consulting. When I left Pedestal Software, as I said they did audit and compliance software and the
            acquiring company, fast forward five or so years, they were looking at possibly getting rid of that
            particular product and I knew that I had already done a lot of consulting with those types of customers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And so I said, well I could build a replacement for this and I started doing it and then I realized there's
            all these legal implications about building a clone of a product that I just did a lot of professional
            services work on. It got really messy but I built it anyway and then was terrified to start really trying to
            push it because it is Symantec Corporation product and I had all of these legal agreements in place.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I tried selling it without going into any of those, which you know in retrospect maybe I should have just
            tried it anyway and if they sued me then deal with it at that point, but I was trying to actively avoid
            getting sued. So that took several years to churn out I'll say and end up being marked as a failure and I
            ended up shutting it down.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            During that process what I found was, MicroConf was going on at the time and because I was in charge of all
            the sponsorships I had to reach out to all these people and asked them if they wanted to sponsor MicroConf.
            I realized at that point there's probably a product here to reach out via email for event organizers and I
            started looking into it and tried to figure out what the financials behind that would look like.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            How much would I need to charge? How much would be worth my time? And I figured okay. Well even if I charge
            them five or six hundred dollars, that's probably a very tough sell to an event organizer. They're only
            going to use it once if they're running one event a year and that's expensive. It's going to be very hard.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I ended up abandoning it and then fast forward several years later when I shut down AuditShark I realized
            that software would have also been very useful during my enterprise follow-ups and I could have really used
            that in a more generic sale scenario. That's where the idea for Bluetick came from, it's because I had
            previously experienced that problem and I discounted it because I was thinking about it for the wrong
            market.</p>

            needs and that's exactly what you did but it backfired because you're applying it to your one use case,
            which is organizing conferences and the business model didn't work out for that use case. Where as it could

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yep, that's right. And it's interesting to see the number of different
            use cases that it's possible to fit Bluetick in as a solution. I mean, you mentioned earlier the thought
            that you had about, oh, I could use it to follow up with people to get them to fill out something on my
            website or I could get them to schedule an interview for the IndieHackers podcast.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Each of those is definitely a viable place where Bluetick could be plugged in because it's a repeated
            scenario that comes up for you on a consistent basis. And you need to manually deal with it which sucks but
            at the same time it's still got to get done. It detracts from your ability to do other things.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'm all about automating things so that you don't have to do them again. My mother would probably claim that
            I'm the King of not-doing-things, not wanting to do things more than once and the King procrastinator, but
            it's really I just don't want to have to do those things over and over again.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Earlier we were talking about just how much can you really automate
            your business. How realistic is to build something that's truly passive income? Even though it might not be
            super realistic it's much easier nowadays to get close to that goal than it ever was because there exists
            businesses yours that automate these tasks that otherwise would be repetitive and take up a ton of your
            time.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'm curious if you ever considered working on a different idea instead of Bluetick because I know a lot of
            people listening have a large list of ideas or at least two or three they want to work on and they're not
            sure which one to pick. What made Bluetick stand out as the one to go with.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Mike Taber [00:18;49] So actually that's a really good story that I probably don't talk about very much.
            There was one idea that I'd had was that I had been hired for to do some consulting work for a company and
            they wanted to have this data aggregated from different spreadsheets together and they didn't really have a
            unique key between them or it wasn't the same one.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And so I had to figure out some system to gather all that data, extract it from the spreadsheets. Match it
            up individually and then also do that overtime and load it into a database so that they can pull queries
            from it. I went through that and I said I think that there's actually a really good product behind this
            because they're paying me a consulting rate. It's thousands of dollars a month to have me work on this for
            them. And I would have done it for probably, it was three, four or five months something that. It was a
            long-term project.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            They're spending $40,000, $50,000 on this. Well it seems to me there's a tool that you could build for this.
            I started validating this idea that I had for a product that would do this type of thing called ETL Studio.
            I built a webpage and tried to drive traffic to it and tried to get people on the phone to talk to them. I
            got a handful of people. It was really hard to get people on the phone to talk about this particular
            problem.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            These people are paying me lots of money to solve this problem for them and there's got to be a market for
            it and there are products out there that do that but I couldn't find enough that we're in a price range that
            I think would have made it a viable product for me to build. I don't think that I could have reached them.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I ended up moving on from that and then I validated Bluetick and the response was 10 to 100 times higher for
            Bluetick than it was for ETL Studio. That's why I ended up choosing Bluetick instead because I did not get
            nearly enough to give me the confidence to actually start building and writing code.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think your story so far is illustrative of why, if you really want to
            start a business it helps to jump in and get your hands dirty without waiting for the perfect idea. Ideally
            start multiple businesses over time and I say this for two reasons.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The first reason is. It makes it way easier for you to recognize what traction looks like. If you only
            started one business, it's very easy to get stuck and say "hey is this really worth spending my time on? Is
            this taking off or is it not?".</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You don't really know because you don't have any reference points. Whereas you started multiple businesses
            you had your game in the past, you had ETL Studio, you have Bluetick. It's easier for you to say look at the
            reception that Bluetick is getting. This is something special. I should keep working on that. You really
            need multiple companies to get that perspective.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think that cheat that I did there was that I didn't actually start a
            business or write any code. I was just trying to get people to talk to so I didn't actually start a business
            for that. I just tried to find people to talk to and I couldn't find them.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that's a great point. You don't really even have to go the full
            distance with the business. You can just do these first validation steps and that's enough to get you the
            perspective that you need.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The second reason, I think people should start multiple businesses is because it helps you come up with
            ideas. If you're one of these people who's paralyzed, you don't have the perfect idea. You don't know what
            to work on just work on a less than perfect idea and in the course of working on that you'll probably come
            up with a better idea if you keep your eyes open.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I think in your story Mike, you came up with the idea for ETL Studio while you were running your
            consulting business. You came up with the idea for Bluetick while you were running MicroConf. A lot of your
            best ideas came out as a result of you working on some other business.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I find it hard for me to resonate or understand the people who say "I
            don't have any ideas" because I think that I have way too many ideas.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I actually keep a spreadsheet or Word document or something that, that just list out things. here's my idea
            for this, this is a problem I run into and there's different things out there. Or it's difficult for me to
            find a solution to it because this one is good at this but not at this other piece over here.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I don't have that problem personally. I see lots of opportunities and stuff. It's more a matter for me what
            opportunities am I not pursuing or what am I going to be giving up by pursuing that particular opportunity.
            I just have too many things that I think would be interesting to go after but I have to pick and choose
            which ones I do and don't.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think that there's a reluctance to do things that have been done
            before and I think I used to fall into this camp as well. Oh I don't want to build a help desk product
            because there's this other company over here that's doing that and I say that distinctly remembering there
            was a help desk product that I did not build back in the 2001 to 2004 timeframe because I found this other
            one that was online that was used in the same types of technologies.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And at the time it was ASP, pre <a href="http://asp.net" class="linkified" target="_blank">ASP.net</a>, just
            classic ASP and I just I said, “Well, they've got a product here that does this. Why would I build a help
            desk product?” So I never did it, but that was an example of one of the ideas where it came from me trying
            to run that free online game.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Where it would be nice to be able to have some help desk ticketing system to help me deal with inquiries and
            questions from people. I didn't do it because specifically I was afraid of building something that somebody
            else had already done.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that's a great point. It's really hard to identify a valuable
            problem that nobody else is solving and then solve it yourself.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But it’s a little bit easier to look at a valuable problem that people are already paying to have solved and
            then bring your own solution to the table that's significantly better than the competition in some way for
            some group of people.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Let's get back to your story with Bluetick. You've returned to this idea after putting it on the back burner
            for a little while. What's the first thing you do to get this project off the ground?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So what I do is I set up a landing page and then I went into my own
            personal network and started asking people about it and I said "Hey I have this idea for a product that
            would do something along these lines. Is that something you're interested in or you have a problem with as
            well? And if so, let's get on a call.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Or do you know somebody who might have this problem? Is there somebody else you could introduce me to?". So
            I did that and I ended up with about 30 to 40 different conversations with people. I spent a long time, I
            spent almost a month going through and having those conversations because each one was about a half-hour
            call.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And I took copious notes on every conversation. I tracked it all in a spreadsheet. And then this is one of
            those Inception-products where having Bluetick at the time would have helped me follow up with the people
            that I wanted to get to a call.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So going through the process of that, I knew what the process was I
            just needed the software to actually do it for me. I had those conversations and I spent about a month with
            them and asked them tons of questions. I said "What is it that you want? How would you see this working? And
            what do you think would be a good price point for this? What would you pay for this or would you pay for
            it?".</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That was the question I had asked, is this something you would pay for? And I got yes-es for most of them. I
            spent about a month, close to three weeks getting Balsamiq mockups built for the entire application. There's
            about 60 or 70 pages. I use their presentation mode to be able to click through to different pieces of the
            application to show exactly how it was going to look and then I went back to those people who said "yes, I
            would pay you for this".</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And I showed them I said this is what I built or this is what I'm going to build. This is what it looks
            like. Is this still something that you're interested in? For the most part most of them said yes, and then
            at that point I said "will you pay me for this?" And I said here's a webpage where you can put in your
            credit card and it will take a pre-payment from you. It defaults to three months.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You can put either one month or up to six months and the text field for how much they were going to pay was
            blank. And they could tell me how much they were going to pay for it and I got about a dozen people to give
            me anywhere from $40 a month up to $100 a month. With most of them clustered between $47 and $50. There were
            nine people in that range. There were two people who said either $39 or $40 and then one person said $100 a
            month.</p>

    <div class="episode-transcript__speaking-turn">

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So this is a huge multiple step process you've got going here. You set
            up a landing page and you started showing it to people to see if they're interested in the idea. Then you
            put in more effort into actually coming up with detailed mock-ups of how this product's going to work and
            you got people to say yeah, they're still interested.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then you hit them with the question. All right, put in your credit card. How much are you going to pay? I
            want to dive into the details behind all of these steps and find out how exactly you did them. But before
            that I want to talk about how a lot of people skip all three of these steps if not one or two of them.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            How did you know this is the right way to go. Where did you learn this stuff? And how does anybody acquire
            the right knowledge and learning that they can go into their business with confidence. They're not going to
            repeat some of the more often repeated and easy to avoid mistakes.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">One, was just from having attended MicroConf for so many years. I knew
            what other people had done and how some of them had validated their own products.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I took things to, I'll say, what amounts to almost an extreme level. I don't know anyone else who's gone to
            the point where they took pre-payments before they even started writing code on something. I'm sure there's
            an example of somebody out there who's done it but I haven't met them and I don't know who they are.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What I was trying to actively avoid was building something that people did not want or that I wasn't going
            to be able to get in front of the right people. I was trying to make absolutely 100% sure that I was not
            making a mistake and was going to spend the next couple of years building something that ultimately I
            couldn't sell because that's exactly what had happened with AuditShark.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I built it because I knew I could build it and I knew that I could implement the things that need to be
            implemented and it worked, the product was good. The problem was I couldn't get in front of the people and I
            wasn't able to sell it in the way that it needed to be sold. It really needed a salesforce and resellers and
            things that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            All things that I actively want to avoid. I used all those things that I did not want to do, to find and
            settle on a product and that could be sold in a way that I did want to sell it. All those things really come
            from years of mistakes and learning more about myself and how I needed to run things moving forward.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, you touch a hot stove once and then from from then on remember
            exactly not to touch that stove again. It's tricky because having been through that yourself it's extremely
            visceral to you how important it is to validate an idea and how easy it can be to be overconfident in your
            idea and start building and it turns out nobody wants it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I think when you're maybe a first-time founder, you're listening to an episode this or you're reading
            about entrepreneurs online. It's hard to internalize the lessons that have been learned by other people that
            you haven't experienced yourself. It's much easier to get caught up in the moment, to get caught up in the
            excitement and the emotions that you're feeling in the president and make all the mistakes you've read about
            other people making.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Mike Taber [00:29;14] I think it's very easy to be overly optimistic, especially as a developer because if
            you're a reasonably good developer you can build just about anything. The question is, how much time do you
            have to do it? And the other thing is, how much runway do you have?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Well, if you have a full-time job and you're working on it on the side, you've got unlimited runway and
            that's not necessarily a good thing. Which I found with AuditShark was because I didn't have these lines in
            the sand that I absolutely needed, to be able to make rent payments for example.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            There was no constraints on how much time I could spend on it, other than public perception, which was
            overly negative in certain cases and justifiably so.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Courtland Allen [00:29;54] Okay let's go through step one of this process.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You put up a website, landing page that describes your idea so that hopefully people can read it and you can
            get feedback from them.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What was your process for actually finding people to visit this website?</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I'd had a mailing list for my personal blog, I leveraged that and
            sent out to a couple thousand people and that doesn't necessarily drive a ton of traffic because if they're
            not interested in that type of product they're just not going to visit it. Then also it filters down even
            further to how many of those people who do visit the page are even going to reach out you.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The biggest thing that I found that was helpful was talking to the people that I knew and saying do I think
            that they're a good fit for it? And if so, I'll reach out to them. Most of what I got from those first 20 to
            30, 40 conversations was people that I reached out to and said, "Hey, I'm building this. I think that this
            might help you. Can we talk?'.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And from there what I always did on every single call, I would ask them, "Are there three people that you
            can think of that would fit a similar profile to you, that would also have this problem? And if so, can you
            introduce me to them?".</p>

            because the audience that you built through those activities isn't necessarily a line of the types of
            customers that you wanted for Bluetick.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So remember the percentage of what I got from Pedestal's sale is like
            0.001%. It's probably about that. That's what my personal blog contributed to the number of people that I
            talked to. It was almost nothing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think that in general building an audience is a good thing to do. The problem is that if you're trying to
            build a software product and it's the first product that you have, what are you actually going to attract
            them based on? You have to attract them based on content or something like that or advice or videos or
            tutorials or educational stuff. At which point you're building an educational product probably anyway.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I feel in some ways that's overly generic advice that sounds good on the surface, but the reality is most
            of the time it doesn't help. And then there's the other aspect of it where this was my personal blog. The
            people there were there to read stuff I wrote about not necessarily read about some new product that Mike is
            developing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            They didn't necessarily care as much. So you're not probably going to get customers from it. I think even
            Jason Cohen had said when he was building WPengine, he blasted out an email to probably ten or twenty
            thousand people and he got three customers from it or five or something that, which does not move the needle
            in any way shape or form.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah it really is kind of a crapshoot unless the audience that you

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So you ended up getting a bunch of pre-orders for Bluetick before you

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Do you remember how much money those pre-orders were worth? And the point at which you decided, this is

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I had people pay me roughly $2,000 in pre-orders. I think I had 11
            or 12 people pay me and each of them paid anywhere from the $40 to $100. Many of them paid for multiple
            months. I think one person paid one month. One or two paid me for two months and everyone else paid me for
            three months.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Collectively it was all about $2,000 in pre-orders. And that was what gave me the confidence to say, well if
            people are willing to shell this out without having actually seen me write a single line of code and based
            on some Balsamiq mockups that I created, it seems to me there's definitely something here.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And I've got this group of 12 people who have already paid me to deliver on something. In a way it's kind of
            like consulting but not really because they're prepaying for something that you're going to build.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah and you're making sure up front that it's not susceptible to what
            consulting is susceptible to where only one person wants it. You're not going to actually start building
            this thing unless you've proven that it's not just a one-off thing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think another thing that's smart about this is that once people have actually put in their credit cards,
            you suddenly have a fire under your ass where you need to deliver what you're building. It's like you were
            saying earlier you don't have any constraints if you're building something in the side of let's say a
            full-time job.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You can keep going forever. Well, if people have paid you they probably want a product by some sort of
            deadline that's actually functional and so you're going to be a lot more motivated to get it out the door.
            What were some of the first things that you did to make sure you could actually deliver this product to
            them? And did you have any deadline to get it built?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Obviously I showed to everybody the Balsamiq mockups that I had and
            walked him through exactly what the product was going to look like. That actually helped in two different
            ways, one is I was able to show it to people and say this is what it's going to look and this is how you
            interact with it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And two, I was able to take that and then I went on to UpWork and I hired three developers to help me build
            it. I essentially went through and vetted them and it took a couple of weeks to do that. But from there, I
            basically set a deadline and said okay in three weeks, we're going to ship. Not three weeks, in three or
            four months we're going to ship this and I want it shipped by April or May.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And we wanted to have it usable and have at least one person on the system and actively using it by that

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I could handle the high level architecture stuff and management of the people and make sure that different
            things were getting done and they were getting done in the way that they needed to be, in multiple areas of
            the application. Many of those things were separate from one another so the email sequences page for example
            can be completely different from the profile page and you don't need the same person working on both of
            those things, as long as they both work.</p>

            I knew that there's lots of these different things that could be done in parallel. Hiring somebody, hiring
            three different people to help work on those things made a lot of sense because I could get more of it done
            in parallel and then I could be essentially responsible for quality control and making sure that things were

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don't believe so, it did in some respects. There were some choices
            that were made in terms of the technology stack and how certain things were implemented. For example, the
            front end was all done in Angular and I have no background in using Angular in any way shape or form when
            the project started. That said I've had to go back through and fix a bunch of things and make them work but
            at the time it seemed a reasonably good decision to make.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think what I would probably have changed is I would hire somebody to show me how to do some of those
            things and different ways of doing them. I would hire probably a developer and say I want you to teach me
            how you would do this. Then hire a different programmer to teach me the exact same thing about how they
            would do it. So that way I get two or three different perspectives because what I found was each of the
            developers I hired had different ways of doing things.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            There were overlaps to some extent but some of them knew better about how to handle certain situations than
            others. What you get is the best and worst of both worlds when you're hiring one person and if you've got
            two or three different people who have never worked together before you end up with a hodgepodge of code
            that in some places works really well and then in other places does not because a different person
            implemented it in parallel.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Going back to the thing where I thought I was hiring three different people to be able to build an app in
            parallel much faster, what I ended up with was some places the app works really well and some places it
            worked really poorly even though it's the same team. It's just because different people were doing different
            aspects of it. I think that just nailing down exactly how things would be handled would have been a better
            way to go.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So l had a full time consulting job and then on the side I was also
            trying to manage these people and then there was another component, the backend component that would
            synchronize with the mail servers that I was basically responsible for. So they were doing their code. I was
            doing mine for the backend system stuff then I also had the consulting gig.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So my time was spent mostly doing those things but then also trying to make sure that what they were
            delivering and checking in was functional and was doing what the specs says it was supposed to do. I think
            the big issue I had was mostly just communicating with them exactly how these different pieces fit together
            and I don't know whether it was, I assume that it's mostly my fault to be honest.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I don't think that I'm a particularly fantastic manager and I think there's definitely a lot of growth that
            I have to becoming a better one and you don't get that unless you practice it. In that respect, it's
            helpful. I don't think that it was a good idea for me to outsource as much as I tried to just because of the
            scope of the product. I think it was too complicated to start off with.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. I wonder what the consequences of that ended up being. I mean
            when you launched or when you first started showing this to the people who had agreed to pay, were they
            upset with the product or disappointed? Or did you have to go back and rewrite it? Or was it full steam
            ahead. this is what we have got, we're going with it.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yep. I think the consequences of it were that it was six to eight
            months of re-engineering lots of things to make sure that they actually work the way that they're supposed
            to and then standardizing the code in different places.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Some places were just radically different than others, for example doing an API call and paging results back
            versus this works fine for receiving 10 rows or 20 rows but we've got to pull back 100,000 here and this is
            just not going to work, so you're going to have to page it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So the whole thing has got to be re-written and we spent or I spent a ton of time re-writing things because
            of issues like that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            How did things change once you launched Bluetick and was there even some singular launch? Or was it more of

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don't think there's ever a singular moment. There was a time where I
            just decided to make it publicly available and that was last August. I decided to just start pushing things
            live and making it available and I think it was last August when I went to my own personal mailing list and
            said, "Hey, I'm going to blog about this.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'm going to do 21 days of videos before I make this thing public". And there's a 21 days series, you can
            watch a five to ten minute video of me basically just talking to the camera for a little while at the end of
            each day about what I did, what I'm going to be doing and then leading up to the actual public launch of it.
            And I used my Bluetick mailing list mainly for the actual launch itself.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I had a couple of different emails that were going to go out, I told people what the product did and how it
            would work and gave them a couple of video tutorials of how they could use it and that's how I handled the
            launch. I don't think there was some single moment in time where it's like, oh, this is ready for prime
            time. I mean, there's still things that I'm going through and reworking. No product is ever finished I'll
            say.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well the video series was just in my personal blog it wasn't to the
            Bluetick mailing list. To the Bluetick mailing list I had three or four emails that was just a sequence to
            get people interested in and have them come and sign up. I roughly doubled the customer base when I did that
            so I went from I think I had 10 to 15 people on it, to about 25 to 30. I mean that helped at the time, so it
            was helpful in sorting out places in the app that were just more broken than I thought they were.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            When you start adding more people into an app that is still very early stage you start finding, you just
            have more people exercising it. There's more use cases that you didn't necessarily account for and more
            people touching something where they're you know, putting in weird things or they're using weird languages.
            I had a customer who they had a Japanese mailbox connected and it worked fine.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then I'll find another customer who had their own private email server connected and that worked fine as
            well. But then I had places where not every mail server follows the RFC's for sending and receiving emails.
            I definitely found places where as I added customers I identified more and more of these emails that would
            just break certain parts of the app because they included a weird character or something along those lines.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Or some RFC was violated and I depended on that being correct to store the data and it didn't so I had to
            fix stuff</p>

            it's taking a long time.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The product isn't what you envisioned and you have situations where your marketing efforts aren't going as

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think mostly because I knew that I just wanted to get away from
            consulting. So very early on when I first started doing consulting I loved it. It was fantastic.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I would get dropped into a customer and it was a different environment every time and I was solving
            interesting things and I was getting paid a lot of money for it. But the problem was I was on the road
            between 40 and 50 weeks a year. There were at least one year that</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think of I was on the road for 45 weeks. And so I would fly in on a Sunday, fly out on a Friday and I was
            there the whole week. It was a different customer every week. If you have a family, that wears on you after
            a while because you never see your family. I got to a point where I was just like I can't do consulting
            anymore.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I just do not want to do it. You can't pay me enough to continue doing it. That's really what drove me to
            say, look I've got to get this out there and I've got to push it to the point where I can actually make a
            living from this and not have to go back to consulting.</p>

            that if I really needed to go back to consulting it's not like I cut all ties and would never be able to go
            back to it. I knew that I'd be able to go to that and make ends meet even if it was only for a little while.

            I knew that I wasn't burning the ship completely so to speak. I could go back if I needed to and maybe I
            just needed a break from it. I definitely don't want to go back to consulting on a long-term basis,
            especially if it involves any travel. Otherwise it's not the end of the world if I had to.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Let's talk about growing Bluetick after your launch. In the very
            beginning when you first had the idea, you've got your pre-orders by reaching out to people in your network
            and making cold calls and getting introductions to other people that way.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then in the weeks leading up to your launch you reached out to your personal mailing list, and you started a
            new mailing list for Bluetick. How did things change after you launched Bluetick? And how did you go about
            finding customers and making sales after that point?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So most of what I've spent my time on it is making the product as good
            as I possibly can and then asking people for referrals and other people that they know that might have a
            similar problem. I found that that's actually worked pretty well. I know that there's definitely room for me
            to grow in terms of doing a lot more online marketing or content and driving more people to the mailing
            list.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I've automated some of those things to some extent but one of the things that I have is, in Bluetick there's
            actually an email sequence that I have set up where I can ask people and say "Hey, I see that you've been
            successful with Bluetick for a little while. Is there anyone that you know that you think could also benefit
            from using this?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And it's interesting you're almost asking for a testimonial but really what you're asking for is for a
            customer referral. The only way that you can get, not the only way but one of the better ways that you can
            get people to basically give you an introduction to somebody else is to give them the best services you can
            possibly give them.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I spend a lot of time making sure that if somebody emails me with support I'm fairly responsive almost
            always within 24 hours and the answers that I give them are fairly comprehensive. If they need help I'm more
            than willing to do things on their behalf. I've gone I've logged into people's accounts fixed up their
            entire email sequence for them so that they don't have to go in and mess around with any HTML.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Just giving them the best possible experience they can have with your software has been, I won't say
            monumental but it's really really helpful when it comes to turning around and saying "Hey, can you do me a
            favor?"</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What you're doing here is very salesy, you're reaching out to people one-on-one asking for referrals and

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I have a Google doc that just lists tons and tons of ideas that I
            have for how to grow the product and I have a hard time going through and deciding hey, I'm going to focus
            on these different things or I'm going to do these things in this particular order. Reality is it's mostly
            just a checklist.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The problem is some of them take a long time to get to the end of. SEO, for example or building a content
            marketing strategy. Those things take a lot of time and effort and money and quite frankly I don't have a
            lot of any of those so I would have to outsource it and pay somebody else to do it, but I don't have the
            funds and revenue to be able to do that either.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Mostly what I focus on is the types of things that I can do without spending a lot of money. That excludes
            certain activities like paid advertising. I don't have the money to be able to do that. Mostly I'll focus on
            things where I'm asking people for help in various ways or providing the best service I possibly can that
            makes them feel so much indebted to me, that kind of thing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And then also promoting things like annual plans that's actually really helpful as well. But you have to be
            able to get people to trust you enough to be able to say "Okay, yeah, I'll pay you for an annual plan."</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's funny because it's super basic and straight forward when you hear
            it, but a lot of people don't have that list. A lot of people don't have a list of all the different things
            that they can think of to try to grow their business or improve or overcome some obstacle.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What they're doing instead is they hear about one thing, they become fixated on it. Maybe that's search
            engine optimization, maybe that's advertising. Maybe that's making cold calls. They say okay, that's what
            I've got to do.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You know so-and-so did that to grow their business, I've got to do that to grow my business. And if you get
            fixated on one option and you don't have a list then you can't compare. You can't compare and contrast these
            options. You can't say which is going to take more time.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Which one do I have more certainty about, which one is most likely to succeed. I think just having that list
            is crucial. Were there any things that you tried that are maybe on your list that didn't work as well as

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That doesn't happen at all. Adding new features almost never adds new
            customers unless somebody came to you and said I need this feature and I'm not willing to sign up until you
            implement it. I actually take that and turn it around.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            This is a good hack for some people, have them sign up and then offer to extend their trial until that
            feature is implemented. If you say that you will implement the feature and then they'll sign up what you've
            done is you've committed yourself to doing work for somebody who hasn't paid you yet and isn't going to pay
            you.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you turn that around you get them to sign up, then they're not off looking for a replacement or some
            other product because they've kind of made a commitment to you already. And that works especially well if
            you can get them to give you the first payment and then you'll give them a credit for one month down the
            road or something like that. At least that way there's that tie in because I did find that with the
            pre-orders for example, I had a lot of people who prepaid me.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then even after going back to them most of them did not stick around and become customers for a long time
            because they had in the meantime went and found other things. They had that problem they needed it solved
            and they needed it solved sooner than I was going to be able to deliver.</p>

            You don't care that someone else has done something similar to what you're doing. And I think that's the

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Personally, I use the trust factor and service. So if I can get
            somebody on to a phone call, I will because I've not only run into this problem and experienced it but as
            the founder of the business people feel much more trusting of the founder of a business when they're talking
            to them versus talking to a sales rep.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I have a list of probably 30 different competitors that I basically track and the problem is that with so
            many different vendors to choose from it's difficult to know who to trust and who not to. If you find one
            and you get to talk directly to the founder that says a lot. People have a tendency to trust that,
            especially developers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I've been in various sales calls before and I apparently have a persona that projects confidence to people
            when I'm talking about technical stuff because it's obvious that I know all the different edge cases and I
            know the different ways that something could be exploited. Or you know misused or just somebody does
            something wrong and I can talk to those things and it's clear to them that I have a certain level of
            expertise.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You don't really get that when you're talking to a sales rep and say "Well how does your API interact with
            this?" And they're like "Well, let me get somebody on my team to get back to you". It becomes this
            convoluted process that they don't want to deal with. Between that and running the podcast and MicroConf
            there's a lot of trust that I try to establish as quickly as possible. And that translates into like I said,
            lots of other things and the ability for them to give you the benefit of the doubt in virtually every
            scenario.</p>

            I think I found that I became acutely aware of that when I was running AuditShark because I felt compelled

            Things are completely opposite with Bluetick and that's great but at the same time I'm not where I want to

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">We're going too fast. Let's put the brakes on. That does not happen and
            don't get me wrong there are certain cases where you may say "Let's not run ads this week because I'm going
            to be on vacation for the next two weeks and I know I'm gonna blow a lot of money".</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's a very different scenario than "I'm good. Look, I don't want any more money." That's not something
            people typically tend to do I think that there is a certain amount of expectations about, oh well Mike
            should be doing much better and you know quite frankly there's times where I look at my revenue numbers and
            I wouldn't say that I'm embarrassed about it but I'm certainly not happy with where things are, where I feel
            I should be.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think that's probably where a lot of founders feel the exact same way. It's you always wish things were
            better than they were and you always plan for them to be better and it almost never works out that way. So
            there's always this lingering, not general disappointment but self disappointment. I should be doing better
            than this.</p>

            in yourself because you just never started.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Whereas if you are someone running a ten billion dollar company, you might be thinking of all the things you
            want your company to be doing and how you're not there yet. You're looking at the Amazon's and the Google's
            of the world and thinking why don't I get to that point?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's hard to internalize but it's really true that there's never a point along that continuum where you just
            feel like you're doing everything you could be doing, because no matter where you get you end up looking
            above you. You want to impress the people who are doing a little bit better than you and you want to reach a

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think you also have to recognize that everyone has a different
            situation. I make it a point to not compare myself in any way shape or form to any business that's funded
            because I'm bootstrapped.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I know that if I had a million dollars, heck even if I had a $150,000, $250,000 in my bank account that
            would enable me to do a heck of a lot more things. That goes down to the question of well should I look for
            funding? And that's a very very different conversation that we could have another two or three hour
            conversation on.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            For me right now, that's not on the table. The question is who should I be comparing myself to? And the
            reality is you should be comparing yourself to yourself, three months ago or six months ago. Are you in a
            better position now than you were? And if not, how can you fix that?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            How can you improve things? Or should you move on to something else? Because if you start comparing yourself
            to other people, it's keeping up with the Joneses. You're always going to be comparing yourself with other
            people and it's never a good scene mentally. You can never catch up, there will always be people in front of
            you. There will always be people who are smarter than you.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it's a very subtle distinction between looking up to somebody and
            respecting them and how they run their business and what they do versus comparing yourself to them and
            saying, "Oh, I wish I were there. I wish I were doing things like you". So for example, Peldi from Balsamiq,
            I very much respect him and I look up to him and what he's achieved with Balsamiq.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I don't look at myself and say, "Oh he was able to get to $800,000 a year in revenue in eight months and
            I want to be able to do that. Why am I not? I'm disappointed with myself.". It's a completely different
            business, everything is different so I don't compare myself to him, but I definitely look up to him and
            respect him.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And if I were to ask him the question I would absolutely listen to what he has to say, but I don't beat
            myself up over the fact that I'm not there.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I've spent a ton of time basically making sure that the app is stable
            and can scale. On the back end it does a ton of processing and because it operates at a fundamentally
            different level than most other applications that are out there that do similar things. And typically that's
            explicitly because during the validation process for Bluetick I looked at what they were doing and how they
            were doing it and said "Well, how can I do this better?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So there were products out there and they said "I like this product and I use it now, but the reason I don't
            like it is because I only get updates once an hour." Then I said "Why is that?". I look around and find out
            that they're using some third-party service and that's what they're using to synchronize the mailboxes.
            They're not doing it themselves.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's part of why it's taken so long for me to get to where I am with Bluetick, but that said I also did it
            myself. I own that entire tech stack, I'm not reliant on an external party. So although I have to move
            slower I have much more flexibility in the technical capabilities at a lower level and those competitors
            don't.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What that has allowed me to do is put things in such a position where it can scale and I've done premature
            scaling, premature optimization for sure. At the same time I also recognize that as I'm adding customers in,
            some customer I added had a mailbox that had 750,000 emails in it and my server just basically handled it,
            it didn't even bat an eye really. But they do that every 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's got to synchronize the entire mailbox and it does that for every single customer but by owning that
            technology stack I don't have to worry about that stuff and by focusing on making sure that the app is, I
            don't want to say stable because it is stable. It's able to handle those types of situations without
            breaking or slowing down or bogging down.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            By focusing on those things I put myself in a position where I can leverage things like a Zapier integration
            or I can go out to Product Hunt and post it there or I can do things that leverage other people's audiences
            to add a bunch more customers in there in a very short time span and not have to worry about the app
            breaking. Because that's more stressful than anything else. if the backend service has stopped working,
            that's a big deal.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it's mostly it's awareness but there are places where Bluetick
            is not going to be the right solution for everyone in all cases. Bluetick includes a lightweight CRM in the
            middle of it but I think that integrating with other CRM's so that you can bring your own and integrate with
            it is helpful.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I mean the way you phrased the question, if it did everything I wanted it to, all those Integrations would
            be in place. I wouldn't have to build them, it's a catch-22 there. At some point down the road integrating
            into other products so that Bluetick is, I'll say a point solution and a specific piece of your sales
            funnel.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's where it needs to go. That's the piece where I would focus and making sure that people are aware of
            it because at the end of the day marketing in general is making people aware of your product and getting
            them to trust it enough to give it a shot to solve whatever problem they have.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And if you haven't done all of those things you're never going to be able to sell the solution to them. But
            you also have to remember you need to make sure that they're getting their problem solved and once they are,
            automating everything. I found that the most successful customers have integrated Bluetick so that it
            automates stuff for them.</p>

            How do you navigate that? Especially when you're a resource-constrained solo founder. When you're marketing
            nobody's writing code and when you're writing code, nobody's growing your product.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I'm crossing that line at the moment. So you could probably argue
            that I could have done that back in December or January, February of this year. I mean, you could probably
            make a case that oh, last August is when you should have done it when you first opened up the doors to the
            public.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But the reality is that if I open up the doors and a lot of people come in all at once, all it takes is one
            customer who crosses a certain threshold and then the entire app falls down on itself. I think a lot of apps
            probably fit that mold where if one thing goes wrong in a certain piece of it the whole thing just get
            grinds to a halt. I've spent a lot of time making sure that I recognize those situations. And either code
            around them or have avoided them and I'm at the point now where I feel much more comfortable moving forward
            and pushing on the gas more to add more people in because those situations have been largely resolved.
            That's because I've slowly added customers in, they find problems,</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I fix them. I iterate, push out new features or new things that will cover different edge cases and then
            they say "yes, this is great, but could you do this over here?" And I just keep iterating on that process
            and at this point, I'm much more comfortable with it. Versus if you asked me to do that last August when I
            first opened the doors, I'd have been really hesitant because if one thing goes wrong.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I've had situations, in November, December time frame where I integrated OAuth authentication and things
            ground to a halt because I used some example code that I shouldn't have used. I basically just copied and
            pasted it from the wrong example. And what was happening is in the background the token would expire and it
            would pop up a browser as the local system account and because there's nobody there, nobody sees it and you
            can't click on anything.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So all of the synchronization stopped working and I only had 20 customers at the time. Let's say I had a
            thousand. I've got a thousand people who I just introduced to this new feature and it stops working for a
            thousand people. Trust me. I do not want that problem.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">But by slowly doing things, by slowly moving forward I think you're in
            a much better position to handle those exceptional or edge cases where something goes massively wrong and
            only a handful of people see it. And I think that's actually an advantage to moving slow.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Obviously there's disadvantages to revenue and profit margins and stuff that, but when you've got something
            as complicated as this on the back end, it's actually a benefit to go slow.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's interesting because it's so dependent on the product that you're
            building, you know for what you're doing. It's so mission critical that these emails get sent, that they get
            sent correctly, that they can handle your customer's workloads.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Or another example would be Stripe. With a business like Stripe, dealing with customer's financial data and
            payments and really the core of their business. And so it's extremely important to be reliable and stable,
            but of course there are tons of other businesses that don't rely on that reliability and stability and they
            have other concerns and so really just comes down to understanding what your central selling points are to
            your customers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What do your customers want? What do they fear? And you can't necessarily just copy what you see other
            people doing. You have to understand your customers.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah and I think that I'm really trying to focus on, I promoted the
            trust factor earlier on today, but at the same time I also want to make sure that the customers are getting
            exactly what they need and that they trust that the app is not going to break on them or not going to do
            things.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I mean, that's one thing that I found from the validation process and asking people, what do you like about
            other products? And what you do not like? What have you tried? And I got up a whole laundry list of
            complaints about other people's products and I engineered it around all of those things. And if I can't
            solve those then people aren't going to trust me. If they're not going to trust me they're not going to tell
            their friends or their colleagues about it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If I can make sure that they never run into any of those problems it's very difficult to bad-mouth a product
            that has nobody bad-mouthing it. Somebody at MicroConf earlier this year and I'm sure this will trigger
            something but they said "I came to MicroConf in the large part because I looked around for bad reviews and I
            could not find one."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            He's like, "I'm not bad at Google. I just couldn't find one." I'm like, "that's great" but now of course
            we're going to get a flood of people.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If you're just starting out and you don't have anything that you've
            built or sold, my first piece of advice is to find something that you can create, that you can charge people
            money for. I think people underestimate how long it's going to take to do that. There's a lot of opportunity
            to just build a pamphlet or a cheat sheet or guide about something.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Whether it's a software development framework or publicly available library. You can put it out on various
            platforms, Gumroad or something along those lines. Where you just sell a very short ebook and you'll learn a
            lot about running a business and the types of problem that you're going to run into just by selling that one
            simple thing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Amazon is a good channel obviously for that type of stuff as well. But you're going to learn a lot in going
            through the process of trying to put something on Amazon. Just by virtue of getting started with a business,
            doesn't matter what it is and selling something online.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's the very first thing that you should do because that will give you the experience and at least a
            little bit of revenue and confidence that you can do bigger things.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think that's great advice and having constraints is so powerful
            because if you can eliminate some substantial portion of the types of things you typically have to worry
            about when running a business then you can focus your efforts to other areas and learn a lot more about
            those.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you build on an existing platform, you don't have to worry as much about marketing. Or if you build
            something really simple, you have to worry that much about development and spending months dealing with
            development issues.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Totally agree there. Anyway, Mike it's been such a pleasure having you on the show and walking through

            discover the show so your support is very much appreciated. In addition if you are running your own Internet
            business or if that's something you hope to do someday you should join me and a whole bunch of other
            founders on the <a href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a>
            website.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's a great place to get feedback on pretty much any problem or question that you might have while running
            your business. If you listen to the show, you know that I am a huge proponent of getting help from other
            founders rather than trying to build your business all by yourself.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You'll see me on the forum for sure as well as more than a handful of some of the guests that I've had on
            the podcast. If you're looking for inspiration we've also got a huge directory full of hundreds of products
            built by other Indie Hackers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Every one of which includes revenue numbers and some of the behind-the-scenes strategies for how they grew
            their products from nothing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            As always thanks so much for listening and I'll see you next time.</p>
