        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don't really blame large corporations necessarily for having the work
            environment they do, in a lot of ways I contributed to it when I was there... I was a really bad employee. I
            created exactly that which I hate, just because I felt like there was no other option, but there probably
            were other options I was just too lazy to do them. I don't think of myself as necessarily a great actor, or
            that I think of corporations as necessarily evil. Just, I personally often don't fit that well into large
            groups.</p>

                href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a> , where I talk to
            the founders of profitable internet businesses and I try to get a sense of how they got to where they are
            today. The voice you just heard belongs to Vincent Woo. Vincent is the founder of a remarkable company
            called CoderPad. He came onto <a href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified"
                target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a> a few weeks ago to share his story and it absolutely blew up. In
            part, that's because CoderPad is a small company that's doing something like $2 million of revenue per year,
            but it's also in part because Vincent has a very interesting personality, so I hope you guys have as much
            fun listening to this episode as we did recording it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Okay, why don't we start off by... I think it's an interesting story and I want to go into exactly what made
            you a bad employee and what that looked like, but why don't we start off with you introducing yourself and
            telling us a little bit about what CoderPad is, and where it is today?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">My name is Vincent Woo, I'm twenty-eight years old from the Bay area. I
            went to college at Berkeley for computer science. I worked at a string of companies, let's see... in order:
            Zynga, Amazon, Google, Everlane, and then I started CoderPad, so I went around the tech block and didn't
            really find my place in it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            CoderPad is itself a tool for interviewing programmers in a more, what I think of as humane manner, so it
            allow you to synchronize on basically a text editor with a candidate over the internet wherever they are
            through a web browser, and also evaluate online the results of whatever code they've written... live in real
            time. Which I think is super powerful and important for doing a real interview and not just a white boarding
            thing.</p>

            as far as I can tell about the differences between bootstrapping and startup-ing via venture capital, but I

            in venture funding, to say you've raised like a $30 million series B can have enormously different outcomes
            for the founders based on liquidity preference, based on overall valuation, based on hidden clauses that
            basically only the board members know about, so there's a huge, huge range of how much independence
            companies are able to retain through fundraising. My suspicion is Google actually, I mean, if you look at it
            today it seems to be acting with relative impunity to it's board's desires so in a lot of senses I would say
            that Google essentially remained indie...</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well I didn't really see another option at the time. It's just what you
            did, like, I need to eat and I was out of college, so you had to do something. I had a lot of ideas about
            projects I wanted to do but none of them seemed like they could ever make money, because they couldn't. What
            I was doing for fun back then was doing stuff like writing cheats for video games and I made a little bit of
            money off of that, but not enough to eat off of. So I was like, well I'm good at this programming thing, I
            might as well work at job at it. To be honest, when I interned at Zynga for the first time I did kind of
            fall in love with the idea that these idiots would hire me, out of Berkeley, pay me some absurd amount of
            salary for an intern... I think at the time it was like $5,000/month, which to me was like an insane amount
            of money to pay to a child, and they put me and another intern essentially in charge of the development of a
            new Pokemon clone that we worked on, on and off for a couple months. It went nowhere, but we hired artists,
            we had all these plans, but we ended up playing a lot of Pokemon in the office. Like, they had cereal on
            tap... all this weird shit. The idea of Silicon Valley being this sort of bubble nerd paradise was foreign
            to me at the time, I didn't really know about that. I just wanted a job out of college, and this was 2008 or
            something right, so people were obsessed with the real estate thing...</p>

            programmers and they are really in their own league. They don't really talk to a lot of other people are far
            as I could tell. The best programmer I ever met in my life was this sixty year old, plus, dude at Amazon and
            he had been there who knows how long. He knew everything there was to know about everything computer
            related, as far as I could tell. It was amazing, and I had no idea why he worked there. It didn't make any

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            There's this notion that there's all this untapped gold of extremely good programmers who are more or less
            content at their job, and just like really being good at it, all around the country, and I believe that. I
            think they're in the vast minority, but I think they exist.</p>

            should do it if they think that it would be satisfying for them to do it, but you don't live a long time,
            you've got ninety to a hundred years tops, right. I like to think of it from the perspective of when I am
            dying, I'll be in a hospital bed, I'll be hooked up to an IV, one or more of my major organs will probably
            be failing, and I know I have like a month, or a week, or a day, and I won't know which, like I wonder what
            I'll think about, so that's how I approach it. I try to look at whatever I can do in the short term, medium
            term, whatever, like what will be memorable sixty years from now? That's a useful heuristic for me. I don't
            always follow it because I'm lazy, but if there's a guiding light for me it is my eventual mortality.</p>

            think he showed me <a href="http://repl.it" class="linkified" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> by that guy, Amjad
            Masad, great guy, they're more focused on education but I was like, you could totally take this and slap it

            wasn't an original creative work, it was just slapping two totally disparate things together and seeing if

            in a lot of respects, and in one of those respects he was very defensive of us. He ran interference, he let
            us do a lot of things that would be difficult in other environments to justify doing. Was that the best
            thing for the company's bottom line? Hard to say, but it let me do things that I enjoyed doing, it kept me

            essentially side project into a business... and when did you realize it should be a business, and not just
            something that you were building for fun or for your own use?</p>

            going to answer in reverse order, you asked me how do I know that a side project should be a business or
            whatever... it seemed obvious, like that's not a satisfying answer but a lot of this stuff is just so ex
            post facto rationalization of the past, and the truth is I don't really know. I probably took a guess and it
            seemed reasonable, and I was like okay, I'll spend an extra few months building on with the payment flow and
            all this other random quota crap, so that other people can use this.</p>

            whatever. We were in this room, we had Thai food. I presented on a projector, I don't really remember any of
            the details, at the end they kind of nodded and said okay, we'll buy, but buying for them was nothing
            because it was like $20/month, and I was like, yes, I made my first sale! Like it was for no money, but it
            was fun, it was kind of when I got hooked I think. Like, I can just drive places and convince people to do

            while it might be hard for a lot of developers, I think it's much easier than they think it is. Sales is,
            most of the time, about being friendly and persistent, not about being mean, so like 1% of the time it's
            about being mean, and you don't even really have to do that 1% if you don't want to. So if you just like
            making people happy, you can probably be good at sales, it's mostly about remembering to send seven followup
            emails, that's a hard part.</p>

            from... it might be Faulkner, I can't remember, but it's about how people who say they always need more time
            and space to their art are almost always making something up. Like, the people who do art do it because they
            are compelled to do it, they'll cram it into every crevice in the day. There's sixteen plus hours in a day
            and honestly you can get through a day job in like five hours if you actually wanted to, so if you actually
            want to do something you'll do it. You don't need encouragement to do it. I generally don't know what to say
            to people who say, "Oh, I don't have enough motivation to do this thing I know I should do" like, that's a
            core personality issue that can't be addressed by advice, or by learning from other people's experiences.
            You have to want to do it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well I think there's a big difference between wanting something, and
            wanting to want something. I think sometimes wanting to want something can be enough, and it can be a path
            to actually wanting something enough to do it, because I didn't always want to do it enough. Only and the
            right time and the right place did I finally feel like I wanted to do something enough to actually do it. I
            had a bunch of projects that never finished, I still do. Like, I work on all sorts of weird stuff that has
            nothing to do with programming or whatever, that just often never sees the light of day because I lose the
            motivation at the end, so I don't claim to have this problem solved... I think I just got lucky. I don't
            think there is a good answer to that, if you don't feel as if you have the time to do something... you may
            or may not be correct, and there's no way for us on the outside to know, nor anything we could recommend
            that will make that easier for you.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I had this idea, so basically there's this company that has a monopoly
            on all of city and municipal governments for hosting archival footage of city hall meetings, which cities I
            think are basically required by law to distribute, so they're obligated by law to engage such a contract, or
            perform this service for them. The existing provider, Granicus, is not really good. I've been using their
            website a lot because I've been trolling a lot of city hall figures. One of the guys at Hackathon that I was
            at for city politics stuff came up with the idea to basically mirror all of their stuff, and then they
            provided transcripts, to make that transcript searchable by time stamps, then you can sort of search any
            given city hall meeting for a key phrase of whatever and instantly jump to that point in the video. I
            thought that's a great start, and I built that basically, then I had the thought, why not just build the
            whole thing and compete directly with Granicus... it seems like a fun business and you basically have a
            monopoly once you land the deal, it seems like a pretty defensible move... I gave up because I got bored. I
            still think it's a good business, I was just distracted again by something else.</p>

            $4,000 MRR, and they were like, why? I was like, okay, here's a reason... it's stupid. It's because when I
            hit $40 MRR, I posted on Facebook as a joke, haha my business makes $40/month guys, isn't that funny? Then
            when I hit $400 I was like haha, guess what, I made 10x what I made the last time I posted, that's crazy
            bro. Then I thought, oh shit, if I do this again at $4,000 that's actually kind of real stakes money, so I
            might as well quit then. Also $4,000 kind of pays for rent and stuff, so that's why. There's no reason to
            it, I just did it because I felt like it. I could've quit at any number, I mean if I quit at the beginning
            it would have been fine too, it didn't really matter.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">These motivational questions are hard for me, I don't think I'm like
            most people. Why was I doing what I did? The truth is, I don't know. I don't actually believe that most
            people know why they do what they do. I was doing a thing because it seemed like the right thing to do
            but... okay, I'm going to take a moment to explain. I'm what you might call an optimistic nihilist, like I
            don't think anything's really real, up to and including money. Money is like a dead person's face painted on
            a green piece of paper... that it signifies material wealth to me is almost amazing. That, that system
            actually works to me is terrifying and awesome at the same time. So yeah, I thought it would be fun to make
            more money, but I knew abstractly that if I failed at CoderPad, literally the worst possible thing that
            could happen to me... is I would just get a job. Which I had proven that I had been able to do at least a
            couple times before that, so I wasn't worried about it. There was no anxiety for, because to me this is all
            a big game.</p>

            just making money and you're not trying to be a unicorn, especially if you're a developer, that doesn't get

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it must be changing. If there exists people like you, who's
            sole job is to promote this lifestyle, I would take as some indication that things are changing a bit. On
            the other hand, I touched on this in the talk, I think this is kind of cyclical. It used to be a cultural
            norm that everybody kind of wheeled and dealed, at least that's my impression. If you go in other countries
            that's way more true too. We probably hit peak corporatism and are trying to dial that back a little bit, I
            think is natural, it was probably inevitable in some respect that people would get upset with... we've had
            cultural satire and lampooning of corporate life for decades now. I remember my entire life I would watch
            stuff like Office Space, or cartoons...</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, no one paints a favorable light of corporate life anymore. There
            is no work that makes the work of an office seem noble. In some ways that's tragic because I don't think
            that's necessarily true, but on the other hand it reflects reality. I think the majority of office work, in
            the world now, is in some way deserving of satire.</p>

            just do your own thing, it's never been easier. You can build something, especially if you're an engineer,
            that reaches across cultural lines, that reaches people who aren't in your immediate vicinity, and you could
            build something scalable like you've done with CoderPad and I think people seeing that really inspires them.

            plan competition, we tied for first, so we got $25k and I lived off of that in Boston for about a year.
            After that startup died, I used the remainder of that money to move to San Francisco, and my plan was really
            just to get into Y Combinator and get funding that way, or to get a job if that failed, so I was kind of
            like you. I knew I could fall back to my programming skills, therefore it wasn't really that scary to take a
            leap. Getting into YC worked out and the money they funded our business with lasted me more than a few
            years.</p>

            the way people used email, then you would get hundreds of millions of users, and then from there you could
            do anything. So we were building this task management application that let you convert your emails into
            tasks, check them off, it would notify whoever sent to you, "Oh, Vincent has completed the email that you
            sent."</p>

            charge a single dime for the product, and this is a productivity tool aimed at business users we were giving
            away for free, but it became apparent eventually that this is not going to work. So eventually we ended
            putting a price tag on it, we were one of Stripe's early beta customers in 2011, and I think in our first
            weekend we made something like $2,000 after we emailed everybody and said that we're now charging for

            businesses he's started, but his writing, eloquently describing what the core fundamental issues of small
            business are were confirmations of long held suspicions for me that pushed me over the edge, like okay, if
            this random guy in Japan can make it doing this random bullshit... in Japan, I can probably do it here in
            America, it's probably fine. Just normalizing these ideas has done a lot. You're definitely normalizing this

            competition in the tech space. I don't think we have enough, I don't think we have nearly enough, and I

            fraction of the attention that I have to give it, and it's like, here, there's an entire team devoted to
            just that one thing. It's interesting looking at the constraints that you impose on yourself for CoderPad,
            for example, you never did any marketing. You never did any... I guess you did a lot of sales.</p>

            task as long as it was two out of those three, so you couldn't do anything hard that would make you money
            but wouldn't make people happy, it had to be easy and make me money, or easy and make people happy, or make
            people happy and make us money then it could be hard.</p>

            how you find out any other piece of information in the world before the year 1990, or whatever. We're

            the other interview a little bit, that founders often get sucked into these productivity holes, where like
            you said, they're coding sixteen hours a day or whatever right. If a solo founder is only programming
            sixteen hours a day, I can promise you they will fail. There's no ifs ands or buts about that, they have to

            about it. Patio11 had a tweet last week where he said, he kind of repeated this off quoted startup advice,
            that your idea is not what matters. In fact your idea is valueless, it's 100% execution.</p>

            with the idea, but on the flip side I think if you look at, especially VC funded startups, there are just a
            lot of founders who take this concept to heart, and who really believe that it doesn't matter how bad your
            idea is when you start. The entire goal of execution, or maybe even the definition of execution is to
            iterate, and to pivot, and to eventually arrive at a good idea.</p>

            you're a solo founder I would highly suggest not doing it, or thinking harder, or finding low cost ways to
            iterate on the idea that don't involve you spending up a whole company first. There's a lot of risk/reward

            start with a good idea that's somewhere close to the mark, you're significantly raising your chances of
            success. How much has CoderPad changed since you first built it? I know one of the early emails I also have
            from 2013 is you sending out an email to everybody at CoderPad saying, "We just hit 1,000 users, here's what
            I'm working on!" then at the bottom you have a whole paragraph basically asking people to tell you, what
            should I build? What came out of those efforts and how much has CoderPad changed?</p>

            redesigned the site a couple times, but not in ways that are shocking, more like streamlining and refocusing
            attention of the user on what we think the important parts of the interview experience are, but
            fundamentally the philosophical value prop is exactly the same as it's always been, it's been refined a
            little bit, but CoderPad as an idea has not changed at all. The original form of the idea is more or less
            the one that exists today, because it was the correct idea I think, I got lucky with that. I could imagine
            another world where that's not true very easily, I don't think I'm a genius or anything, I just lucked into
            the right problem at the right time, and had the right set of skills to execute on it. I wasn't the only one
            with this idea trying to execute on it at the same time, there are other people with similar backgrounds who
            try to do CoderPad that I never even knew about, that I found out were dead later, or were still kind of
            limping along. I just happened to be the one that won. The reason I am sitting here talking to you is
            because by definition, I am lucky.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            This is the problem with advice in general, I think all Indie Hackers interviews should come with a
            disclaimer, just because I think it would be funny, but like, by definition when you ask successful people
            for advice what they do is they enshrine, it's a hagiography, they just blow up these little details of
            their life and give them such explanatory power, like I could sit here and tell you why optimistic nihilism
            is the correct philosophy to have for someone who wants to start a business, but I don't really believe
            that, I have no idea. By definition the people you talk to are the lucky ones, what they should really say
            is the way to be successful is to be lucky.</p>

            have some control over but not a lot, so I'd say the real advice is to not worry about it so hard, the odds
            are you will fail. That's okay. You have to be okay with that before you can do it. If you absolutely cannot
            let yourself fail, then you shouldn't be doing one of these, I don't think.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">We were lucky to win the confidence of certain large customers, it's
            not clear exactly why that happened, I just happened to know someone at the right place, or got an intro, or
            something like that. It's maybe surprising, but I actually don't have many friends in tech, so I didn't
            really have an easy time getting intros to tech companies, of the few that I did they tended to pan out
            pretty okay. I remember one time, Bob Lee, he was a VP at Square or something like that, gave a talk at the
            VC that put most of the money for Square when they recruit all the founders to come have a conference or
            whatever, and he had some panel on hiring and he just told the whole crowd, "Hey, you should buy CoderPad.
            It's this weird product made by some guy named Vincent Woo." The only reason I heard about it was because my
            boss at Everlane at the time texted me, "Hey, heard you're doing pretty good buddy!" and I was still
            employed there, like I had no idea this even happened. That was lucky, some of that stuff sort of
            serendipitously happened in the background, and it was useful for getting going, but I think it would have
            worked even without that stuff honestly, it'd just been slower.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">My perception of how vulnerable the company is. At the time I probably
            was worried more about attracting attention of the wrong sort... I was just anticipating a bunch of
            difficulties that I don't think actually now will manifest. For instance, if our customers know our revenue
            numbers will that change discussions we have with them? At the time I might have been a little paranoid
            about that, but now I don't think that's nearly as likely as an outcome, it seems like so much more of the
            business has gelled since then that I feel like the company is in a pretty good place and that it can
            totally tolerate sharing some of it's internal workings with the outside world. Not because I think sharing
            is the right thing or anything, I just felt like bragging. I'm going to be totally honest, It's mostly
            vanity. After four years to be able to brag about it a little bit feels nice, because I've actually been
            really secretive about it. I've definitely brought people over who have expressed incredulity at the idea
            that I am a wealthy business owner given the way my then apartment looked like, with my roommate, and the
            living room, with the bedding in it, they kind of look at me like a crazy person, so it's nice to get a
            little bit away from that. I have to admit, it's for me.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Right, I think you should get people who have fucked up in a huge way,
            if you can somehow entice those people, because you're only getting the success viewpoint. I don't think
            doing a business is as much about doing everything right as it is not committing a few huge errors that
            everybody commits. Do you think of the game of tennis as being about making the best plays, or not making
            mistakes? At the highest levels it's about making the right play. At every level below the highest level
            it's about not committing unforced errors. There's this YC saying, I crib a bunch of notes off YC, we owe
            them a lot, that more startups die by suicide than by murder, and that's absolutely true. I've seen so many
            people fail for completely avoidable, stupid reasons that everybody but them saw coming, it happens over and
            over again. Listening to the successful people they say things like, oh yeah I knew what I was doing, we had
            this plan, we did it, then we were successful, which I think lulls people into this sense of, okay if I just
            feel as if I have a plan and do things I'll be successful. The truth is, they did the right thing. The
            difference between the right thing and the wrong thing is really hard to illustrate by only interviewing the
            people who did the right thing. I think interviewing people who fucked up in this incredibly huge way I
            think is totally valuable.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think a lot of the reason why people do the wrong things, or avoid

            up on or excelled at, and they just do the wrong thing, but it's because sometimes they don't even know. For
            example, like you said earlier we kind of live in this society where customers have been reduced to bits,
            and just numbers and words on a screen. Where in reality, you should be talking to your customers and it's
            difficult for a lot of people to... or a lot of people fail to talk to customers not because they've decided
            they don't want to or that it's not important, but because it doesn't even strike them as something that
            they should be doing.</p>

            idea for the last ten years. YC's been around a while, it's definitely changed the game. If you haven't
            heard the notion, that starting a startup, you should probably talk to your customers... every VC would
            probably tell you that, anyone you'd go to advice for would probably tell you something like that. If that
            lesson hasn't sunk in, there's something deeper there, it's not just that you don't know but that you're the
            kind of person that really doesn't want to do that for some reason or another, like, why. I think that's a

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I totally agree, I think advice is often useless. You can tell people
            exactly what they're doing wrong and make it a really stark, obvious picture, and they can still ignore you.
            Like that Paul Graham quote about their business in YC is giving founders advice they know they'll ignore.
            This is endemic to human nature, people don't like advice. You have to trick people into doing the right
            thing almost half the time. That's a key learning for sales, but what's going on there, what are we doing
            with this, is our to convince people to do the right thing? By producing information like this, how likely
            do we think it that we will materially effect outcomes? I think that's a really serious question that people
            who make a living off of advice giving need to ask themselves, and I think there's very little serious
            examination of even the basic idea of like, does advice work? We know so many famous people who have
            predicated their whole persona on advice giver, and they're respected by the community, but have they
            actually ever changed an outcome? Who knows, it's very hard to quantify.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's difficult for sure. I think people act on advice to the extent
            that it's obvious that advice will be valuable for them, that's why insider trading is a thing, because
            people will act on information but it just needs to be clear how that information is going to help them, and
            it's difficult to measure too. At Indie Hackers this is something that I think about... how many people are
            starting companies because of Indie Hacker's interviews, how many people are making better business
            decisions because of something they'll hear in a podcast like this, or something that they'll read in a text
            interview, or somebody that they talked to on the forum, I haven't figured out the best way to measure it
            yet...</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">How many people did anything based on something they read in a
            interview, this is a real problem. Stelly [unintelligible] had that YC sales workshop that I snuck into, and
            at the end of it he was like, okay you should make a list of discovery questions you should ask and if any
            of you does it, you can send it to me and I will vet them, but I know none of you will do that. He knows!
            People don't do things, it's really really true. People only do things that they wanted to do already and
            it's very very hard to change what people want to do. As a founder, I think one of your primary virtues
            should be flexibility, you should know abstractly that your job involves doing a hundred different things,
            or you should be prepared to do a hundred different things, if you're not doing a hundred different things,
            maybe you're doing the wrong thing, it's not just any one thing, it's like you have to do everything. You
            know that well from having done Indie Hackers as a side business, or like your full time gig actually, just
            the management of this entire pipeline of stuff must be exhausting, but you have to do...</p>

            talk to your customers, make something that people want, ect, and people will see that and say, yeah yeah
            yeah I've already heard that, even thought they're not doing it at all and completely skipping it just

            embarrassment by saying, really really I don't know everything, but the advice I would give is it's not
            about even execution advice, I think it's about your personality as a founder more than anything. Again,
            founders commit suicide way more than they're murdered, so don't commit suicide, don't do weird stuff, do
            the right thing. Think really really hard about the next right thing to do is, it's going to be different
            for every company so most advice is too general to be useful here, but I think the one piece of useful
            general advice is if you're not really thinking hard about what the next thing to do is... maybe you're
            doing something wrong. What assumptions do you have remaining that have not been questioned sufficiently,
            are you sure your business will work, like why are you sure, can you convince other people that this is
            going to work? If everyone around you is skeptical, why are they skeptical? Seek to validate your own
            judgement, don't just assume everything will work out for you because most of the time it doesn't. Try to
            set up some checks on your own reasoning and emotions because people generally speaking don't make decisions
            logically, we just do them by feeling all the time, right, so if you know that's true about yourself because
            it's true of everybody, the only thing you can do is try to set up some guard for yourself. I didn't do
            that, I just got lucky, but I know that's the right thing to do and we try to do that more now.</p>

            Vincent can you tell listeners where they can go to find out more about you personally and about the things
            you're doing at CoderPad?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you enjoyed listening to this conversation and you want a really easy way to support the podcast, why
            don't you head over to iTunes and leave us a quick rating or even a review?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you're looking for an easy way to get there, just go to <a href="http://indiehackers.com/review"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/review</a> and that should open up iTunes on your
            computer. I read pretty much all the reviews that you guys leave over there and they really help other
            people to discover the show, so thanks a ton for your support!</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            In addition, if you are running an internet business or if it's something you'd like to do in the future,
            you should join me and whole bunch of other founders on the <a href="http://indiehackers.com/forum"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/forum</a> . It's a great place to get help with
            pretty much any problem that you might encounter while growing your business, like how to come up with an
            idea or feedback on a product that you're working on. I try to spend a couple hours a day answering
            questions and giving people feedback, and getting to know everyone, so I really hope to see you there.
            That's <a href="http://indiehackers.com/forum" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/forum</a>
