            always, so the rest of us can learn from their examples and go on to build our own successful internet
            businesses.<br><br>
            Today is a special episode. I'm here with Lynne Tye, the founder of Key Values. What's up Lynne?</p>

            norm. Everyone's in this space. I remember you would always be coding at parties and whatnot. People would
            literally be chugging beers behind you and you'd drink a beer and then go to your computer and code.<br><br>
            In college I was in brain and cog. I always wanted to be a professor. My mom, my dad and my sister, they're
            all academic professors. So even before I got into college, I knew for certain that was my calling. And so,
            in college I was laser focused on doing research and making sure I got good grades and everything that set
            me up for success for that path.<br><br>
            And then when we moved to San Francisco, I was doing that. I went to UCSF to get my Ph.D. in neuroscience.
            You were still coding. You've been so consistent. I've had so many life changes and you've – I mean you too,
            but more or less linear. And then when we first moved, I remember you were like – I don't know if you've

            figure out what it was. But ultimately it was just that I wasn't doing something that I loved.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Totally. Seven years older. I have one older sister. You know Kay
            really well, but Kay and I are super close, and she's always been like this mentor-role model for me. She's
            a professor at MIT in neuroscience. We wanted to do it together. My sister and I would be like, we're going
            to start an institute together someday. Which was actually not -- definitely ambitious, but that was our
            north star.<br><br>
            It was a really big deal when I decided to not continue down that path. It was really hard on my family. It
            was really hard on me and it was definitely by far the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life. And I
            talk about it a lot, though, because it's also a huge part of my identity.<br><br>
            Honestly in a lot of ways it's still behind the ethos of Key Values where it's just like life is just way
            too short to do something you don't love. And if you're miserable every single day doing your work, get the
            fuck out, like quit, do something else. I think it's scary when you're older, in your 20s and your 30s and
            beyond, to like just change careers. But just do it. I think that's kind of where that came from.</p>

            research progress and I was eating this bagel, it was like 8:30 a.m., the bagel was stale. I was so tired,
            and it was so boring. And I just literally had this "Aha" moment when I was like, I don't have to do this.
            No one's making me do this. This isn't a life that I have to live. So, I can choose, and I choose that I'm

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">No. So, it's true. After I dropped out of grad school, I had no plan,
            which was obviously really scary. Everyone is like, "Have something lined up." But I just knew that I
            wouldn't be able to figure out what I wanted to do if I was doing something that was draining me every day.
            (Laughs.) Stop laughing.<br><br>
            I did not quit grad school to become a taxi driver. After I dropped out, I didn't have a plan. I barely had
            any money saved. When you were in grad school at that time it was like a $30,000 stipend. So, I was really
            poor. So, I had to make money. Sidecar was this thing that was the competitor to Lyft. UberX didn't even
            exist yet.<br><br>
            Someone was like, "Hey, you have a car, you should drive for Sidecar. " And I was like, "Cool, I need
            money." I was basically a cab driver.</p>

            like the classic soul-searching journey. Yeah, I did that for months and it was actually -- that was hard,
            too, because it was around Christmas time and I had just dropped out of grad school still. And my parent, it
            was uncomfortable. My family was not – they wanted to be supportive, but it was just so hard for them to be.
            Then I came back to San Francisco and started working at Homejoy, which is an on-demand cleaning company,
            which is really cool and well- funded. But at the time my parents were like, holy shit, our daughter dropped
            out of a Ph.D. program in neuroscience to work at a cleaning company. We have failed. We have truly, truly,
            failed. I don't know. I don't know what they thought, but they just were like really, really worried and
            kicked off a panic. And then I think Homejoy got written up in Forbes at one point and my parents were like,
            “Oh wait, what is this? Maybe it's okay.” That was interesting having to explain that. Tell me about getting

            of the cofounders of Homejoy went to MIT was your class, I think. And there are several other, like MIT
            people, they weren't like close friends of mine, but they reached out and it was because I went to your Pi
            reunion. MIT has this reunion 3.14 years after you graduate – so nerdy – in Vegas, I think it's always in
            Vegas.<br><br>
            I crashed the year above me and they remembered me because I was like really bossy this one day because I
            was a long story. Everyone was putting their stuff in my friend's cabana and then the people at the, at the
            club were like, “You can't do this. There are too many people in your cabana. And so, I just like stood on a
            table.<br><br>
            It was at the pool and I was like, “Hey, everybody, you’ve got to get your shit out of here. They're gonna
            throw it away.” This guy was like, “Oh, she's bossy.” And he recalled that memory and hit me up to be like,
            “Hey, I remember you bossing people around. You want to be a manager?” So that's literally how I got that.
            So random.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I was like, "It's fucking awesome. Join us." And you were like, "Hell
            no." Homejoy was my first real job. I was getting paid, I started at 65K, but at the time I had just come
            from 30K a year. It's more than double and it was all the things I was craving that I wasn't getting from
            grad school.<br><br>
            It was super-fast paced. It was super high energy. It was really social. I was traveling a lot when I first
            started. It was just everything that I needed. It was a journey, man. We all worked long hours. I don't
            know, 80, 90 I feel like there was definitely a couple of weeks where we'd work a hundred hours a
            week.<br><br>
            We slept at the office. I know saying this, a lot of people are like, "That sounds awful." But it was
            really, really fun for us at the time. I think we were just super passionate, and whenever you're passionate
            about something, it's always -- there's nothing better than finding other people who are equally passionate
            about the same thing, too.<br><br>
            Homejoy was a really good experience. I was a manager, so that meant -- it was my first job. I was like 24,
            25. I was managing 150 plus people. It was crazy how much work experience I got crammed into those few
            months.</p>

            it was this rocket ship startup. I didn't know very much about it. I know they kept raising more and more
            money. I remember going to some party you invited me to you where it's like they had just raised $40
            million, and it was some elaborate party.</p>

            leases and keep going to a bigger office because we kept growing. We went from -- we were just in San
            Francisco and maybe Seattle or something when I joined and then we were in over 36 cities across North
            America and Europe when I left. It was pretty wild.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's a really good question. My heart just wasn't in it at some point.
            I loved it until I didn't. I think there was -- it wasn't the long hours or anything, it was just the
            direction. My vision for Homejoy was that it was like more of a matchmaking service. Which is super
            foreshadowing for Key Values. I think I just like making good connections.<br><br>
            In order to be the Uber for anything, -- it's like the idea for the direction of the company was that it
            didn't matter who showed up to your house, you'd get the same quality clean. And in my mind, that's not
            possible. Letting someone into your private space for four hours, unattended, when you're not home is a
            really big deal. There's no way that you can make two people do that same job, the same.<br><br>
            I think when I realized that my direction, the direction of the company wasn't something that I was really
            passionate and excited about, it was time to go. I left before things got -- started looking bad and
            everyone thought was I was so crazy for leaving. In fact, everyone was like, “Oh, where are you going? Are
            you going to go start your own company?”<br><br>
            And it pissed me off, actually, at the time because I felt like everyone was just projecting their Silicon
            Valley dreams onto me. I was like, "No, I'm not like -- if you want to do that, you should. But stop trying
            to --" I don't know, it was a weird time.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It was weird, too, from my perspective because you had been so adamant
            about trying to recruit me. You were Homejoy's biggest champion, their biggest cheerleader. I would go there
            sometimes and work on my laptop because you were trying to get me to work there. And I never even really
            considered it, but to see you sort of 180 from "Everybody should work here, it's so great," to, "Hey, I'm
            not really feeling it," and eventually quitting, was pretty shocking.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">To be fair, everything, when you're working at a high growth startup,
            is accelerated. It wasn't like overnight. It was probably the last six months were me figuring out that it
            wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be or what I thought it once was. I think this is something I see
            commonly now, actually relevant to Key Values, is that people say, "Things used to be X, Y, and Z," and
            that's just the nature of startups. Like you can't – it’s impossible for a company to stay the same way from
            15 employees to 150 employees. It's just, it's impossible. I outgrew Homejoy or maybe Homejoy outgrew me,
            I'm not sure. But we started diverging.</p>

            more backpacking, soul searching, and that's when I decided that I wanted to learn how to code. Which I
            thought you'd be excited about, but then when I told you, you were like, "Nah, man, I don't know. I don't

            that's just not my learning style. And so, I knew that I wanted to do something like a bootcamp.<br><br>
            So, I did something called Dev bootcamp. I wanted it to be in person. I wanted to have experts who knew all
            the answers to my questions, be able to answer them when I ask them, and I need to not feel guilty asking
            them a hundred questions every hour. And I wanted to have other people who are learning with me. So, I did a

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I probably quit in April. I remember I quit Dev Bootcamp around my

            then the first real gig I got my own was in July, maybe.<br><br>
            But to be honest, I don't know if I would say I knew how to code. I don't know. This is a constant debate.
            When, at what point, does someone know how to code?<br><br>
            COURTLAND ALLEN:] 00:23:11] Well, eventually there came a point when you were getting contracts without my
            help. Because the first contract I was like, "Let's get a contract together and we'll sort of work on it
            together." And I think that was a cool learning experience for you. At some point, I think maybe it was
            January the next year and maybe even earlier than that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So this is the question people ask me often and I wish I had a better
            answer. I don't know if it was partially luck or timing or if it was luckily, I had this network. But for me
            to get my gigs in the beginning was kind of random. But the thing I definitely did was tell every single
            person that I knew that I was open and available for contract work as a web developer.<br><br>
            And the other thing I did that was really careful to do, because three months before that I was non-
            technical. I didn't even know what languages meant, I didn't know anything. I made sure to let everyone I
            knew who didn't code know that, "I'm available to make websites, I'm available to write in these
            languages."<br><br>
            I made it really clear and easy for people to remember because otherwise people, they just don't know what
            kind of engineer you are and then they put you in touch with their company and it's not a good fit. It's
            obvious. I was really lucky. I think most of my gigs came in from people that I already knew.</p>

            of contract web development work. And I guess I always just felt like I got kind of lucky getting jobs. I
            would make something cool just for fun and then get inbound requests, but I didn't really have a network or
            tap into it.<br><br>
            And then you came on the scene and less than a year after learning how to code you were making -- I think
            you're charging like a hundred dollars an hour. All these clients --.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I went from like $30. I remember the first time –because in the
            beginning –. And this is advice everyone will give you, is start building side projects so you have a
            portfolio, so that when someone reaches out or you reach out, they have something to look at. And so, I
            think for me it was like, "Why don't I just get paid to build my portfolio? Why don't I get paid to
            learn?”<br><br>
            There are people who just need some basic – like the Shopify example. She had a very simple site. She just
            wanted some help figuring out how to make a new landing page or something. I should do that and get paid.
            So, I was like, "Pay me $30 an hour."<br><br>
            Because I would've done it for free. And it was like a weird thing. And it's really analogous to doing sales
            for a company, knowing how much your rate is, how much you're worth. And then eventually the story of how I
            started charging $100 an hour is embarrassing. So, I don't want to tell it.</p>

            short. And then he like paused, which probably wasn't even longer than half a second, but I'm just so
            crazy.<br><br>
            I was like, but I'll do it for $65 and then he was like, "Um, why don't I just pretend the last 30 seconds

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's so funny hearing you say it now because it's like, "Wow, that
            sounds magical." But it was a lot of hard work. It did not feel fast at the time at all. I remember, I was
            getting antsy. I was like, "What am I going to do to start making money? When am I going to start making
            money? I'm starting to run out of money. I need to get a job. How do you know you're ready? What kind of
            gigs should I get?"<br><br>
            I remember in the beginning you were talking me through this. I was like, "I need to build up my portfolio,
            but I don't have much more time to keep building and learning on my own without getting paid. So, if someone
            offers to pay me to simultaneously build my portfolio – because when you work with a client that's building
            your portfolio.<br><br>
            How low can I go? Because if I'm going to do it anyway, why not do it for $30 an hour? And you were like
            "No, Lynne do not. That's way” -- you're like no, no, no. I think it's hard to know, but just say a number
            and take a stab at it. And people can always negotiate down. Don't do what I did, which is backpedal
            immediately.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Oh God, this is like memory lane. So, I actually remember a lot of
            this. So, I remember in December and January, like the cold, rainy months in San Francisco in 2016, going
            into 2017. I was so into making money because this is honestly, you just heard my whole backstory. I did not
            get paid very much at Homejoy.<br><br>
            It was like the first time in my life that I was making real money and I had never, I didn't obviously save
            any money from my grad school days. So, I was like addicted to just watching that dollar amount grow my bank
            account for the first time and I was working – I had two full time clients. I was like working around the
            clock, worked through Christmas and New Years and I felt like I was really killing it.<br><br>
            And then it must have been March. Yeah, I worked through February. March was like this crazy storm. It was
            like a perfect storm of events. So, the weather was getting nicer, which is, I know that sounds crazy, but
            for me, weather really impacts my mood. My mom had just visited. My mom lives in Hong Kong, so I don't see
            her very often.<br><br>
            She was 70 and was supposed to retire, but she was actually traveling to San Francisco because she was doing
            some talks or something because she'd actually just made this huge discovery in science.<br><br>
            I don't know if people care about the details, but she basically made this huge discovery and breakthrough
            in science and was like peaking in her career. And that was so inspiring because my mom's like 70 killing
            it.<br><br>
            And then also, at the same time you, Courtland, were entertaining this idea of getting acquired and I was
            like, "What? You just started Indie Hackers eight or nine months ago, what's going on?"<br><br>
            And all that happened, and I felt really inspired. There are all these exciting things happening around me.
            And then I had no outlet because my project ended, and my other main client actually had to pause the work
            that I was supposed to do.<br><br>
            I was supposed to do this huge project that's coming up, but they needed like four or six weeks to get it
            started and do paperwork with the third party that they were using. It's a long story. But basically,
            everything was happening. I had all this energy, I felt super inspired by you and my mom. My birthday was
            coming up. I had so much energy and nowhere to put it.<br><br>
            I think I kind of went a little crazy and I was like, "What do I do with my life?" I had this whole
            existential crisis of like, "What do I want? Like what is the purpose of – what is the meaning of my life?
            What do I want?" And I think everyone -- you and my mom both were like, "You should just follow your dreams,
            Lynne. Like do whatever you want, follow your dreams."</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">No, you were like," You should start a side business." You were doing
            Indie Hackers, so you were like, "You should start a side business." So anyways, what freaked me out was I
            didn't have a clear dream and that was freaking me out because I was like, "Oh my God, I'm a shell of a
            human walking around planet earth, dreamless,” this was a dreamless state.<br><br>
            And I remember I was like seriously manic for a couple of weeks. Then I realized that there was like three
            things that I think maybe could count as a dream because I had sort of wanted them loosely for at least a
            decade. And they were one, I always wanted to do an Iron Man. Totally random. Two, I always wanted to start
            a family and have kids.<br><br>
            And then three, I think I always wanted to, in some way work with my friends, in some capacity and maybe
            have some type of -- in a perfect world, would be so cool to have a business that you own.<br><br>
            I think everyone knows this, but consulting is a gateway drug into entrepreneurship because you get a taste
            of the freedom and setting your own schedule. You get to create your own little world and set your own
            rules. So, I'd been sipping on that for a couple of years and I was like, “Yeah, I like that.” I guess dream
            number three was like maybe starting a company with my friends or something of that nature.<br><br>
            Then obviously, Oliver, my boyfriend was like, number two, starting a family. Let's not – don't chase that
            dream just yet. So, I picked number one and three.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">All right, so we're not going to talk about the Iron Man as much, as
            this is a show about entrepreneurship. Let's talk about dream number three, starting a company, working with
            your friends, and following, like you said, the gateway drug of consulting into entrepreneurship.<br><br>
            You eventually settled on the idea for Key Values. How did you get there if your dream was as vague as, "I
            want to do something and maybe work with my friends.”? How did you sort of shape that into the concrete
            vision that became Key Values?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I tried to think of a bunch of ideas. They were all really shitty. I
            wasn't excited about any of them. I started some and 24 hours later I was like, "I'm over it." And then you
            were like, "Well maybe you should find a full-time job." Because I also was pissed that you had abandoned
            me.<br><br>
            So, I didn't say this before, but the deal was if you helped me learn how to code, I had to promise that I
            would try consulting, not become a full-time employee. And I was like, "Deal." So that was how I even
            started thinking about consulting.<br><br>
            And then here this whole – as long as I've ever known you, you're like, "Being an employee sucks, like Blah
            Blah Blah." And then here you are, entertaining becoming an employee of Stripe. I felt so betrayed. I felt
            betrayal. It was weird because I'm like, "Okay, you're leaving me out in the dust."<br><br>
            Then I was like, "I should look for full time jobs." And so, I spent a week or two on a job search and it
            was just so shitty, and I complained about it so much. And it finally, like always, when you're like, "All
            right, Lynne, you've been calling me about this. Could you build a business around it?"</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, if you remember, actually it's so funny. I kind of forgot this
            detail, but there's part of me is like, "Well maybe, will you hire me for Indie Hackers? Like maybe I should
            work with you." Or like "Maybe I should help Oliver with his company," he's a startup founder also. That
            way, that checks the boxes. So, I was also, for a couple of weeks, loosely seeing what other startups there
            were.<br><br>
            And of course, I was looking at like what my friends' companies were doing, because then I could then work
            with my friends. But the process of looking for jobs was so dreadful, so, so, so dreadful. For me, I've
            always had a strong affinity for startups, like being scrappy and starting something early. I never was
            interested in working at the Googles and Facebooks of the world.<br><br>
            But I couldn't find any information about these cool startups. And I felt like that was ridiculous because
            you know, I'd worked at Homejoy, which was a YC company. All my friends were in the startup scene. We were
            sitting in Fi Di, which meant in a 10-block radius, there's hundreds of thousands of startups.<br><br>
            But I didn't know, how do you know that they exist? And then, of course, people are like, “Go to Angel
            List,” and then you see a long list of companies and logos and not knocking angel list. But it's just the
            long catalog of companies with their logo and that's it. And I just felt that they all start looking – you
            scroll and scroll, and they all look the same. And you don't get to know anything about these
            companies.<br><br>
            And so, for me, if you're going to work at a startup, like anyone else, you're not doing it for high salary.
            If you are, you're doing it wrong. If you're optimizing for salary, go somewhere else. But if you're working
            at a startup, it matters so much who you're working with because that's the value. And for me it was just
            felt so crazy that I couldn't get to know the people I'd be working with until so much later.<br><br>
            And I know this is – I wasn't – I'd only been coding for two years. I wasn't a super senior expert, but I
            still feel like I'm a really good hire. I think that any startup would be lucky to have me because I work
            really hard. I'm really scrappy. I'm really good at learning on the job. Throw me into any situation, I'll
            figure it out. And I think I felt a little offended by all of the hoops that they ask you to jump
            through.<br><br>
            You have to write a cover letter, you have to apply, you do a phone screen. Sometimes you do a screen with
            someone who doesn't work at the company. They're like a third-party recruiter. They're not technical. You
            ask them a bunch of questions, they can't answer it. You wait a week, they invite you on site, you do a
            bunch of coding questions, you pair, you do some whiteboard questions, then you come back tomorrow and then
            you wait another week for them to decide.<br><br>
            What is all this? You never even really get to sit down and talk to the people you'll be working with. This
            is the pain point. And you were like, "Well how do you turn this into a business?" And it was like, "I wish
            there was a resource where I could learn more about what the day to day was like before I even have to
            commit to a conversation with these people because maybe it's not even a good fit."</p>

            It's good to have competitors". And it took me so long for that to click, so long.<br><br>
            And that was another, "Aha," moment. I remember, I was driving in a car. I was listening to your ass on my
            speakers interviewing someone else. I pulled over cause I was like, "Holy shit, that makes so much sense."
            Every other industry aside from tech, there's tons of people making new sunglasses. I think that was her
            example.<br><br>
            There are a lot of other companies that make sunglasses, but people start companies that make new sunglasses

            Here's the thing that is a pain point that's very valuable to solve as evidenced by the fact that money is
            changing hands here."<br><br>
            And then you went in search of, "What's the product that's going to fix it?" And after talking to so many
            other founders, especially first-time founders, it's more common for people to do things the other way and
            say, "Oh, I've got a great idea for this thing I want to build. I don't know who's gonna use it. I don't
            know why they're gonna use it. I don't know if they'll pay money for it, but I want to build this thing."

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I talked to technical recruiters. I talked to every single person I
            knew that was an engineer, which was a lot of people. Engineering managers. I was researching dating sites
            and Myers Briggs. I wasn't sure what it was. Should I administer some questionnaire to help people figure
            out what they want and then match them? I didn't know what it was.<br><br>
            But it's interesting hearing you always talk about stuff like this and I was like, why it's a good idea. But
            for me I was never in danger of doing it the other way because I'm still relatively new to building. Like it
            would take me a long time to build something.<br><br>
            So for me it was like I have to be fucking sure that this is – I really have to plan a lot before I commit,
            because unlike you, you could like whip up a product in a day and be like, "Okay let's iterate, let's start
            over. Here’s a new idea." For me, it would take me a lot longer. In no universe would I ever just start
            building something and see if someone uses it. I just never –.</p>

            The answer it was basically a catalog of all the ex-Homejoyers now worked. I just milked my network, again.

            have 2,000 sessions a day without pushing anything. I could go on vacation and have 2,000 sessions a day.
            I’m still working towards that goal. It’s hard work and this is the part of showing up every day for two
            years. Content marketing, a little SEO.<br><br>
            I launched a side project; I did side project marketing inspired by Unsplash crew guys. I don't know but
            someone posted on Hacker News. I’m not giving credit. We saw this post on Hacker News – or sorry, on Indie
            Hackers about someone who had done side project marketing.<br><br>
            And I was like, “Oh, cool. Maybe I should do that.” Because content marketing was like not that fun. So, I
            built Culture Queries which was this tool, you can go to it on Key Values now, but it suggests good
            questions for people to ask their interviewers.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">You may have to remind me because I’m not going to answer this
            question. I’m going to answer a different one. I just want to say that I never, ever would’ve started any
            company and definitely Key Values without Indie Hackers. Because like I said, after my experience at Homejoy
            I was like, “Uh-uh. This is not for me.”<br><br>
            I was convinced to start a company was that you pitched investors, you get them to give you money, you hire
            a big team and then there’s all this pressure to grow really, really fast. I didn’t subscribe to that model.
            It was only through you, talking to you as a friend, not even using Indie Hackers at the time, to be
            honest.<br><br>
            But for those months of you being like, “I just talked to this really cool guy.” I’m making something up. I
            don’t remember who was who, but they’re like, “There’s this one guy living in the mid-west and he just built
            this thing and he’s making 500K a year by himself. And he doesn’t even work that much. Isn’t that
            cool?”<br><br>
            And I was like, “Yeah, that is really cool.” Then you’re like, “Hey, I met this other guy who, like, he
            blogs a lot and then he started this newsletter and he was like, ‘Hey, people love my newsletter. Maybe I’ll
            just charge people $3 a month to read my newsletter.’ And now he’s making 40K a month.” I was like, “What?
            People do that?”<br><br>
            I was like, “Holy shit, there’s other ways to start a business?” For me, that was always the plan. So, the
            YC thing was a really random thing. I totally didn’t think about doing YC and then I talked to someone and
            they were like, “Oh, you know, applications are due soon. Maybe you should apply.” And I was like, “No, I
            don't know because my experience at Homejoy, companies that raise money, not so good.”<br><br>
            I think I got Jedi mind tricked. Someone was like, “You know, it’s a really good introspective exercise.”
            And I was like, “Okay, I’ll do it.” So, I filled out the application and it honestly was, I recommend
            everyone fill out a YC application. It’s just a nice – it’ helps people zoom out because you’re just so
            focused, you’re so close to what you’re working on every day.<br><br>
            It’s nice to step back and see it holistically. And I got the interview. I remember you – did you tell me
            not to do the interview? I can’t remember your advice.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That’s, to me, what the identity of Indie Hacker was and so doing YC
            was like selling out in a way. It was weird. It sounds stupid. Everyone’s like, “You got into YC. Of course,
            you’d do it.” For me, I wasn’t positive.<br><br>
            But the main reason that I did was like, I am helping really cool companies who are doing really cool
            things, talk about them and get on people’s radar, because people want to know about them and YC is a
            network of really cool companies doing really cool things that no one’s ever heard of.<br><br>
            So, I was like, perfect. I was definitely opened because this is my first time ever doing anything. I wanted
            to stay open-minded about different ways to run and build the business.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">YC was really hard for me for a number of reasons. One of them was just
            that I was just so – and this is true for everyone, but I just didn’t handle it very well. I was so
            overwhelmed by the amount of advice. Pre-YC I’m in a desert, looking for water, water being advice from
            smart people.<br><br>
            And you go to YC and you’re drowning in an ocean. There are all these smart people, there’s all these
            partners. There are super experienced founders. They have so much good advice to give but of course, that
            advice is not – a lot of it was conflicting and it was just really confusing for me.<br><br>
            And there was all the pressure of leading up to demo day. YC is three months. You pick one metric and you
            focus 100% to growing that number and for me it was like – even talking to you we couldn’t even agree what
            the metric I was trying to focus on. Do I even want to do demo day and fundraise? And they’re like, “Why
            else would you do YC?” It was really confusing. Thrash/</p>

            fundraise.<br><br>
            I think if you talk to some partners at YC they won’t agree with that statement. But it felt like that in

            just dipped before Demo Day. I didn’t go. And I’ve never been to one since. But every founder, one person
            from each company goes on stage. I think it’s a 60-second pitch to a room full of investors.<br><br>
            You are just trying to get people to give you money. And for me it was like, it was just all so conflicting.
            You read all these essays from PG. There’s just conflicting advice everywhere.<br><br>
            Whereas if you don’t need to fundraise, don’t. If you don’t need to raise money and have investor and board,
            then don’t. And so, I was like, “Okay, I don’t need to.” I had been prepared to do this bootstrap,
            self-funded thing and live super poor and frugal and eat ramen every night.<br><br>
            I was prepared for that. I was just confused that other people at YC were telling me, “You should fundraise
            now. It’ll never be easier. You never know – you might not need the money now, but you might later, and
            it’ll be too late.” Everyone else was so excited about Demo Day. It was really confusing.</p>

            There aren’t right or wrong answers. The truth is, if you raise from angels, it’s not the same as raising

            goes into doing Demo Day and fundraising. Since I’m a one-woman show, if I’m spending two months
            fundraising, that means no one’s working on the product, no one’s doing sales, no one’s growing developer
            traffic.<br><br>
            And so, it was just a really expensive decision to me. And it wasn’t – and I know this sounds all hippy
            dippy and whatever, but I think the best way for me and making decisions is just what energizes me. Because
            I had two years of runway, it wasn’t an issue of running out of money, it was more of a concern that I would
            get frustrated or uninspired, unmotivated and quit. So that was what I was protecting against.</p>

            just went back to focusing on the company. There are definitely lots of good things I got out of YC, don’t
            get me wrong.<br><br>
            One of them, for sure, was they pressured me to start charging. During YC – it was funny. They were like,
            “Wait, you’re providing value? Companies that you have let onto Key Values for free are hiring engineers.
            What the fuck, Lynne, charge them.” That was a huge debate, too, when I start charging, when’s the right
            time. I could talk about that for a long time because that’s just --. You’re looking at me.</p>

            already providing a service to these companies. Charge them money.”</p>

            actually, it’s around this – right about now, at the end of February, beginning of March. I didn’t even know
            how much to charge. It was a long journey for that. Basically, 2018 I would characterize as learning sales.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s hard to describe because it was random AF. The first thing I did
            was reach out to companies that were on Key Values already for free and had positive feedback for me, people
            they had hired. One thing I underestimated is it’s really hard to get people who had something for free and
            convert them into paying customers.<br><br>
            That was one mistake. I should have had everyone new – everyone that was new onboarding starting to charge
            but I didn’t think about that. Looking at other job boards, there are other job board that are anywhere from
            $200 to $500 to post per month. I was thinking about doing monthly subscriptions, three months, six months,
            twelve months.<br><br>
            I was experimenting like crazy. People at YC --. It was cool, actually. Other founders, we were all going
            through the same thing, price testing. It’s like, “How are you guys choosing?” One of them is straight up
            throwing out numbers. One thousand, ten thousand, five thousand until someone says yes. If someone says yes
            too quickly, raise it.<br><br>
            It was literally random. I should’ve been more strategic, had more structure. You have to ask. It forced me
            to talk to a lot of people about what value they did find out of Key Values. Then there’s the whole journey
            of onboarding new companies. So, at some point it’s clear that you should just start charging new companies,
            getting people who are free to start paying is really hard.<br><br>
            My process in the beginning was anytime a company reached out, I would just send them the same email
            regardless of the size of the company, regardless if it was founder or recruiter emailing me, regardless of
            how many people they were trying to hire. It was just the same email. I think I started with $1800 for six
            months and $3,000 for a full year.<br><br>
            Some people said yes, and most people probably said no. One lesson for sure is that I started doing sales
            calls and that was much, much better.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Oh, my goodness. My memory is so bad. First renewal. That was big. I
            think every time I placed an engineer. That was super huge. It’s so fun to celebrate with a company. “We
            found an engineer who found us through Key Values. Thank you so much. They’re wonderful.”<br><br>
            Every time that felt like a huge milestone. I’m so thinking about sales that I can’t help but look through
            this lens. One of the sales milestones, “aha” moments I had was just to actually jump on the phone and talk
            to people and sell. Like I said before, I was just sending these emails. There was this whole questionnaire
            during YC, should you have a pricing page?<br><br>
            Someone had a really strong opinion that I should make Key Values self-serve. There was this moment of
            realizing that if it’s a complicated – if it’s a product that people don’t get right away, it’s not obvious.
            It’s like, “Is it a job board? Is it employer branding? I’m so confused. Are you an ATS?” Which is an
            applicant tracking system. People were not so clear.<br><br>
            Jump on the phone, have them tell you what their problems are and then tell them how specifically your
            product can solve those pain points. And then mention pricing. I think that was a huge – once I figured that
            out it was like a switch. Sales were going so much easier. Raising prices was a huge milestone, I suppose.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I just started saying a higher number. I remember in the beginning in
            the middle of the sales call I’d be like, I had a Google Doc opened. Say $5,000 a year. Say $6,000 a year.
            I’d be like nervous, nervous. They would say something. I would, as I was saying the sentence right before I
            said the dollar amount, I’d be like, “It’s $3,000.” I would just go back and backpedal again.<br><br>
            It’s just a confidence thing. Then eventually I started talking to companies and I had a sales guru, that’s
            what I like to call him, Danny. He definitely coached me a lot. He was just like, “Say a big number you can
            always come down. If anything, companies like to hear that they give discounts.” So, say $10,000. Look at
            their – it’s a video call. Judge their face.<br><br>
            Some companies are like, “Okay, yeah, it sounds normal.” In which case, you’re like, good thing you said
            $10,000. If they pause a lot work down from there. If you give them a discount, ask for something. This is
            another thing, if you’re going to give a discount, don’t do it for free. Instead of $10, 000, “Okay, well,
            I’ll make it $9,000 if you promise to do a case study, participate in a case study and also be a reference
            call if another company wants to talk to a customer.”<br><br>
            There like still, “Uh.” “Okay, $8,000. And you’ll help me write some content.” Just ask for things every
            time you give a discount.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s funny because we don’t talk about it as much because it’s not your
            domain. First thing that’s cool is that every time I jump on a call, the first question I ask is, “How did
            you come across Key Values?” It’s so awesome and the most rewarding thing to hear that most of the time
            it’s, “One of our engineers or engineering managers came across it and sent it to us.”<br><br>
            Sometimes I’m talking to the CTO and they’re like, “I saw it. I don’t even know where I saw it. I think
            someone tweeted about it and then I saw it on Hacker News. Then someone else sent it in the Slack channel.”
            So people are just seeing it and then the other cool thing is there are, I don't know, maybe one out of six
            or seven calls, if I’m talking to a recruiter, they’re like, “Actually, we were interviewing this engineer
            and they asked us why we weren’t on Key Values.” That’s how we heard about it. We were like, “What is this
            thing? We feel bad that we’re not on it because we’re trying to close this person.”<br><br>
            That’s been really cool because it means I’m reaching the right people. What’s interesting is I’m serving
            this two-sided marketplace but engineers that are looking for jobs end up finding jobs and when they’re at a
            company that isn’t on Key Values, they are a champion for Key Values. Then when I work with companies, I
            always work really closely with the team to create the content and oftentimes it’s a handful
            engineers.<br><br>
            I work with engineering managers. Now that I’ve been doing this for almost two years, sometimes those people
            leave those companies. And they’re like, “Hey, I remember when we chatted. I was just wondering if I could
            pick your brain or if you wanted to help me make intros.” Then they become users on the other end.<br><br>
            I’m, of course, happy for them to use Key Values on the other side. It’s like this cycle – or what do you
            call those things again?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So random. Danny – someone that I met introduced us because of
            something totally unrelated. It was like, “What’s it like leading a company and how do you figure out next
            steps?” The soul-searching career – all the things you’ve been asking me today. How did you know what to do
            after you dropped out of grad school?<br><br>
            How did you know what you wanted to do after you left Homejoy? Transition questions. Hey, Lynne has been
            through a lot of transitions. She’s a nice person to talk to. We started talking and at the end of the hour
            I was telling him about Key Values and how I was struggling with sales. And he was like, “Oh, yeah, I’ve
            done 15 years of sales. What kind of questions do you have?”<br><br>
            And I was like, “Well, one thing I’m working on right now is this company asked for this –” I don’t
            remember, it was something that’s not that remarkable but anyone who is doing sales, like, how do I respond
            to this email? Obsess over every word and how you phrase things. At some point we had to go, and I was like,
            “Could I pay you like a couple hours to sit next to me and just walk through all my emails and figure out my
            flow.”<br><br>
            One question was like, should I have a pricing page? Without hesitation, he was like, “Do not have a pricing
            page.” It was so funny. It was something I was grappling with for months and all these people had different
            – and he was just like, “Based on what your product is, you should not have a pricing page.”<br><br>
            So obvious. I was like, (Makes sound.) oh my god, I want to keep talking to this guy. We ended up becoming
            friends and, I was like, I want to compensate him for his time and his wisdom. That’s just one example. You,
            for sure. Cadran, Anurag of Render, which now Indie Hackers is now host of.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">People who know me. Adora introduced me to Cadran way back when both of
            us were starting out building our products. Anurag just told me yesterday that someone told him about Key
            Values and that’s how he reached out to me. I think it’s just in the power of reaching out.<br><br>
            If you want to reach out to someone, just reach out to them. Send them a nice email. There’s definitely an
            art to reaching out, doing the cold outreach. Just even on Twitter, just engage with someone. If they make a
            tweet, just comment, reply. If you reply once a week, at some point, I bet you do, you notice if someone
            keeps replying to or engaging with your tweets you just start to notice them.<br><br>
            Then when they reach out it doesn’t feel like they’re a stranger. And it’s natural. There’s lots of people
            that are really smart that I meet that we don’t end up being friends with. I get excited when I meet people
            I can help with. I’ve always been a fan of bartering. I feel like anytime someone gives me something, I want
            to give something back.<br><br>
            I apply this, it’s not – I don’t think it’s transactional. I don't know, people hate on me about this. Same
            thing with friendships, if someone is a good friend to you, I want to be good friend back. I want to show up
            and be there for you when you need me the most. I want to return the favor. It’s just a natural thing of
            finding your people.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think a big part of it is just building cool stuff and putting it out
            there. Because you built Key Values. No one else built Key Values. Of course, people are going to want to
            get to know who you are and you’re going to meet interesting people because they think you’re interesting,
            too.<br><br>
            So, you just glom onto each other and build up this cool network of people. You could have just as easily
            never built Key Values or never released it; in which case it would’ve been much harder to meet interesting
            people. I think the second half of that equation is, it’s not just about building anything, you want to
            build something that works ideally.<br><br>
            We talked about this earlier, but you started with a problem and then you worked backwards toward the
            solution. I think if you had done what you had done in the other direction what you would have ended up with
            is probably just a job board. You would have said, “I’m going to build a job board.”<br><br>
            And you would have released that, and it would look no different than any of the 10,000 other job boards on
            the internet and it would be much harder for you to find people. I think you did it the right way for
            meeting interesting people.</p>

            this is what I’m going to do.” It’s funny to hear this bird’s eye view. To be fair Key Values isn’t a job
            board. It kind of is. I remember when we were first – you were helping coaching me through getting into
            YC.<br><br>
            That was my one-liner. In my application to YC, I looked it up the other day, was like, “Key Values is a
            culture-driven job board.” For engineers or something like that. I think of Key Values now less and less
            like a job board.</p>

            I can’t explain it, but once I realized it was this amorphous, hybrid thing that straddles recruiting and

            people? What should I do? Danny’s doing a transition. He’s doing a lot of other stuff, he’s doing
            consulting. I was like, “Oh, do you want to spend a few hours a week helping me do sales calls?”<br><br>
            We just started doing this in January of this year. So, I hadn’t been doing sales calls. But he was out of
            town this last week. I forgot how much I love doing sales. Just having not done it for a few weeks and then
            jumping back into it, I had this epiphany that I don’t care about scaling. I think I knew this deep down
            inside. I think this is why I didn’t want to fundraise.<br><br>
            I genuinely enjoy doing this stuff. I know it sounds crazy. I get so much energy doing sales. I love talking
            to people. I love someone being like, “Oh, my god, I think you’re really going to help me. I can’t wait to
            work together.” I’m like, “Me neither, like, let’s be friends.” In a way I feel like Key Values is just, I
            found a way to help people and network and make friends and also get compensated for it. That’s the dream.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I actually had another revelation earlier this week. This week was a
            big week, in that I think that after dropping out of grad school, I realized – when I dropped out of grad
            school, I felt fucking scared. I spent six, seven, eight years building toward this dream. I was very
            outcome focused. This is my destination: I want to be a professor.<br><br>
            Then leaving that it’s like, fuck, I’m starting from scratch. I’m 24, 25. I literally can’t lean on any of
            my previous experience. It’s scary to start over. And you feel so behind. I feel so behind, behind everyone
            else. But I think that in a way freed me. And now I know there’s no time to waste doing shit you’re not
            excited about. There’s this article. I shared it with you earlier.<br><br>
            It’s like being focused on the process rather than the outcome. Not only is it less fun focusing on the
            outcome but it’s something I learned a long time ago. However, it’s like a fragile focus. And if I’m around
            other people, since I’m so extroverted, I just absorb everyone’s energy, I have to be really careful about
            who I’m spending time with because I do get caught up.<br><br>
            If five people walked in here and they were so excited about opening up a bakery, I would no doubt start
            getting excited. “Oh, my gosh, should I help? Courtland, should we open a bakery, too? Should we help them
            open this bakery?” I’m not even kidding. It’s kind of crazy I’m just super-excitable. Because of that YC was
            just like --.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s funny, I think – I don’t think we’ve talked about this at all but,
            as you know, when I started Key Values I literally had a mini-life crisis when that happened and I was like,
            “What are my goals? Looking for a new job.” I started Key Values at the same time as I decided to start an
            Iron Man.<br><br>
            Long story short, I was like, “What are my dreams? What do I want to do?” If I died in ten years what would
            I want to accomplish? And Iron Man for – I don’t even know if you know. It’s a 2.4 miles swim, 112 miles
            biking and then you run a full marathon, which is 26.2 miles. When I started thinking about it, I was like
            “I’m not sure if I can physically do this.”<br><br>
            And it wasn’t a confidence issue. It was just, realistically I’ve had injuries. I have this knee problem. I
            don't know if I can physically do it. But when I did, it was like cool to look back just a few months ago at
            something I genuinely thought was impossible and feel like, “That was nothing. Let’s do it again.” I have
            just borrowed – I apply that to Key Values.<br><br>
            There’s nothing that’s impossible. Honestly, it is not impossible for me to make a million dollars a year.
            Or even ten. Maybe I’d raise money, maybe I won’t. It’s definitely possible. It’s just, do I want to do
            that?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Two things. First, don’t build a to-do list app. (Laughs.) I’m kidding
            but I’m actually probably not kidding. The main thing I would say is be good at asking for advice. I learned
            this the hard way. Perfect example is during YC I would ask for advice without first prefacing it with what
            my goals are and what my circumstances are.<br><br>
            So instead of asking, how do I start a business? What’s a good idea? Frame it with some other things like,
            “How do I start a side business as a full-time employee?” If you’re a parent, if you have kids, maybe you
            should mention that. If you don’t know how to code, how do I start a profitable side business as someone who
            doesn’t know how to code and only has time on the weekends?<br><br>
            That’s a much more specific question and you’ll get answers that are much more relevant to you than just
            asking like, “How do I start a company?” I think being good at asking for advice. And then the hard part,
            which I’m still working on, too, is being good at filtering that advice.<br><br>
            There’s no wrong – I guess there is bad advice but sometimes there’s multiple pieces of advice that are
            different and they’re all good. Instead of thrashing and figuring out which is the better one, it’s really
            just a question of what you want and you should filter it through a rubric of what you enjoy doing, what’s
            going to – how do you flex your own advantages, I think, is my advice. That's meta.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If you enjoyed listening to this conversation and you want a really
            easy way to support the podcast, why don’t you head over to iTunes and leave us a quick rating or even a
            review.<br><br>
            If you’re looking for an easy way to get there, just go to <a href="http://indiehackers.com/review"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/review</a> and that should open up iTunes on your
            computer. I read pretty much all the reviews that you guys leave over there, and it really helps other
            people to discover the show, so your support is very much appreciated.<br><br>
            In addition, if you are running your own internet business or if that’s something you hope to do someday,
            you should join me and whole bunch of other founders on the <a href="http://indiehackers.com"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a> website. It’s a great place to get feedback on
            pretty much any problem or question that you might have while running your business.<br><br>
            If you listen to this show, you know that I am huge proponent of getting help from other founders rather
            than trying to build your business all by yourself. So, you’ll see me on the forum for sure as well as more
            than a handful of some of the guests that I’ve had on the podcast.<br><br>
            If you are looking for inspiration, we’ve also got a huge directory full of hundreds of products built by
            other Indie Hackers, every one of which includes revenue numbers and some of the behind the scenes
            strategies for how they grew their products from nothing. As always, thanks so much for listening and I’ll
            see you next time.</p>
