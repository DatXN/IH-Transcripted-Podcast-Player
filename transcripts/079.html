            listening to the Indie Hackers Podcast. On this show I talk to the founders of profitable internet
            businesses and I try to get a sense of it’s like to be in their shoes. How did they get to where they are
            today, how did they make decisions at their companies and in their personal lives, and what exactly makes
            their businesses tick? And the goal here as always, so that the rest of us can learn from their examples and
            go on to build our own profitable internet businesses.<br><br> Joining me today for the second time on the
            Indie Hackers Podcast is none other than growth expert Julian Shapiro. Julian is the founder of Bell Curve,
            an agency that not only helps founders grow their businesses, but also trains teams so that they learn how
            to grow their businesses on their own. Julian, welcome back to the show and thanks for joining me.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So much to cover. The last time you came on, you told the story of Bell
            Curve and how you got started, how you became an expert at what you do. Today’s episode, I think we’re going
            to do things a little bit differently. Rather than just telling your story, we’re going to experiment with a
            little bit more educational content than normal.<br><br> We’re going to talk about the things that everybody
            needs to know about growing their business before they get started with their business. We’re going to talk
            about things that people should know before they even come up with the idea for their business. You, Julian,
            obviously having worked with dozens of companies to help them grow, are I think the perfect person to come
            on and talk about this, because you’ve seen story after story, lesson after lesson of what works and what
            doesn’t.<br><br> In fact, the reason I wanted to have you on in the first place is because of a tweet you
            sent out a few months back. It was a little bit cryptic, but you said, “Given equal founder skill,
            e-commerce and mobile apps succeed much more frequently than software-as-a-service startups do.” So you’re
            saying that people are better off opening an online store and selling goods, or starting a mobile app, than
            they are building a web app from scratch and trying to charge a monthly fee. So let’s start there. What are
            some things that led you to that conclusion?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If you look at all the clients that my agency has worked with and look
            at the rate of success when dividing by the type of product they sell, say it’s SaaS, say it’s e-commerce,
            say it’s a mobile app or even a Chrome extension. E-commerce succeeds the most frequently.<br><br> Then it’s
            probably mobile apps, particularly those that deal with transacting finance in some way. Let’s say it’s a
            Bitcoin app. Let’s say it’s a friend-to-friend payments app. Let’s say it’s like Robin Hood investing.
            Mobile apps that help you transact money.<br><br> The third was Chrome extensions, which was super
            interesting to me. Because they’re a wonderful Trojan horse to getting easy one-click installs. Then once
            you have that install base, you can piggyback off that to monetize as long as you’re offering value. But the
            point here is the friction to install is so minimal, relative to getting someone to create a fully-built out
            profile on your SaaS product, or even downloading and installing and signing up for a mobile app. We can get
            back to that.<br><br> The point is, for our purposes here, that the very bottom of success frequency are
            SaaS apps. This isn’t to say, “Don’t pursue SaaS. You’re going to fail.” Nor is it to say that if you have a
            great SaaS idea, it’s going to perform worse than a bad e-commerce idea. It’s controlling for quality of the
            idea, quality of the market, and founder skill. I feel pretty confident with that sort of hierarchy that I
            just shared.</p>

            people to under-estimate how hard it can be to grow something. People tend to focus on their ideas. They
            tend to focus on what they want to build or create.<br><br> But it’s totally possible, even likely, that you
            can have a great idea and you can put in all the work to turn it into a real web app or a product or mobile
            app. And then it turns out that you don’t get any users. You can’t find any customers. You realize too late
            that growing your business is actually the hard part. How often do you work with companies whose businesses
            are just stagnant and not growing at all?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If they’re coming to us it usually means that they care about growth.
            And they understand the value of growth marketing, which is the type of marketing you do when you care about
            tracking results very carefully and optimizing how you spent money on marketing to maximize those
            results.<br><br> As opposed to, say, brand marketing where you’re trying to “get the word out.” You want to
            get everyone to know about what it is you’re doing, but you’re not really tracking how much was spent that
            was then made profitable. What was the full experience that that visitor had with your ads across both
            Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere? Did they pay you more than you spent to acquire them as a
            customer?<br><br> It’s that sort of data-focused means of ensuring you’re spending profitably. And all of
            the skills that are involved in that process. That is what defines growth marketing. So if a company comes
            to us and they’re cognizant of growth marketing and its importance, they’re usually not in a dead zone. I
            have this odd selection, this odd view port into companies that are more often succeeding than not.<br><br>
            But what I do have to work with very often are companies that are just starting out and it’s a complete
            blank slate. They don’t have any of the systems in place to do those measurements to<br><br> ensure they
            spend profitably. Sometimes they’ll start by asking me, “Should we kick it off with brand marketing? Should
            we get the word out? Should we be very cautious to be consistent in our visuals?” Meaning, “Should all our
            ads look the same? Should we hire a designer from day one and really hone our brand voice?”<br><br> My
            response is always, “That is a luxury that you should indulge in once you’re actually demonstrating people
            want your product and that you can spend money on marketing profitably.” It’s not to say you want ugly ads.
            It’s not to say that you want inconsistency. Those things are nice. But neither one of those opposites,
            meaning pretty ads and consistency, are what make or break someone’s ability to do growth marketing well.
            It’s many other factors that we’ll dive into.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like that you’re talking about ads. I like that you’re talking about
            paid acquisition channels. I was just talking to a friend yesterday who said, “Isn’t buying ads kind of like
            cheating? Isn’t that a cheap way? Shouldn’t you just be able to build something and people show up because
            what you’ve created is great?”<br><br> It gets me thinking about how much of a herd mentality there can be
            among founders and people who want to start businesses. We look at our favorite stories, look at the people
            that we admire. We see how they’ve grown their businesses and we think that’s how it should be done. That’s
            the only way to do it. When in reality, there are a variety of channels and strategies that you can use to
            grow your business and get it off the ground. Depending on the idea you’re working on, some of these
            channels might be a good match or they might be a bad match.<br><br> You’ve worked with all sorts of
            different companies. You’ve written about this online. What are your thoughts on how people can choose the
            right growth strategy for their companies and how people can become more aware of all the different options
            for how they can grow their companies?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The interesting thing about ads is there has never been a client or a
            company I’ve seen where I could have said to them, “No. Don’t run ads.” Unless they simply could not have
            done them profitably. For any client that even approximates profitability, ads should always be run. They’re
            not self-indulgence. They’re not an excuse to distract yourself with other means of acquiring customers,
            that some may argue are better, and they probably are right.<br><br> But it’s always a complementary thing.
            It’s never a luxury to get ads to work. The reason for that is it is the quickest, most in your control,
            most scalable, most reliable form of getting traffic. Getting people to your website. Having that control is
            so important for a few reasons.<br><br> Number one, when you’re trying to figure out what works on your
            website, you want to move forward through those tests efficiently. If you’re just waiting on word of mouth
            or organic traffic, meaning traffic coming from Google, that could genuinely take months, half a year or a
            year to build up to any sort of significance, if ever. If you want to run a whole bunch of tests on your
            website to figure out, “How can I improve its performance?” meaning “How can I get more people to buy?” that
            is going to require, just from the sake of statistics, a bunch of traffic so that<br><br> you can test your
            changes on people. The more traffic you have, the more tests you can run in any given period of time. We can
            get more into that if you’d like.<br><br> Also, ads are very often made profitable. People simply don’t do
            them right, so they cannot sustain the profitability indefinitely. You’ll hear very often, people downplay
            the importance of ads because they burned on them. They tried them, they got something approximating
            profitability and then, after three or four months of running those ads, suddenly the performance crashed
            and they were no longer profitable. They thought to themselves, “Ads are unreliable.” Actually, to be frank,
            you lacked the skill or the experience to keep those ads running profitably for a long time. That’s
            something we can get into.<br><br> One more layer on that and I’ll wrap up here, is not only do people burn
            out ad performance very commonly - almost every client that has ever come to us reached that state prior to
            reaching out to us. That happens all the time. It’s very normal.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like that you mentioned that a lot of growth strategies can take a
            ton of time to kick in. I’ve interviewed a lot of founders and seen this exact phenomenon. I talked to a
            woman named Christy Laurence whose app took ten months to get built and the entire time she was working,
            spending those ten months on actually growing to ensure that when her app was done being built, it had an
            audience, she can find customers, make money. If she hadn’t put in that time, she would not have been able
            to sell.<br><br> I’ve talked to also – you mentioned mattresses. I talked to the founders of a mattress
            company called Tuft and Needle. They actually used paid advertisements in order to validate their idea. They
            got a mattress. They wanted to try selling it. Rather than doing all sorts of very slow methods of reaching
            customers, they literally just took out an ad and put it on the top of Google for mattresses, to see if
            anybody would click through their website and actually buy this mattress. That sort of proved to them
            instantly, within a day, that their idea was something that at least someone, somewhere, would care about.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Exactly. In proving within a day or so that people are interested in
            what you have, which was only achievable through just quickly spinning up ads and spending money for an
            afternoon, you could have just saved yourself going down a rabbit hole for four to six months, waiting for
            the traffic to accrue. In which time you’ve blown and wasted all these hours going down a wrong direction.
            So it’s not only efficient cost-wise, it’s also efficient time-wise, to rely on ads in the very early
            days.<br><br> Then as you get other channels working, a channel being a place that you get people from. So
            word of mouth is a channel. Buying traffic on ads is a channel. SEO, right, search engine optimization,
            getting traffic from Google to your blog for example, that’s another channel. Referrals, sponsorships.
            There’s a whole bunch. The idea is that until those take off, ads is great in the short term at minimum. But
            the argument I want to make is, even in the long term they’re usually also great as well. If you do them
            properly.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The first framework you can consider is are you a direct to consumer
            business? Or are you selling to other businesses? An example of the first category, the B2C, business to
            consumer, would be something like selling a toothbrush through your website. It is the individual who buys
            the toothbrush. In contrast, a B2B business would be something like, you are selling email marketing
            software, like MailChimp if anyone’s heard of that, to a company that is trying to email their users or
            their customers.<br><br> If you start in that framework, that will help you narrow better into which of
            those channels are most likely to work for you. Once you’ve decided between the two, there’s then a little
            bit more sub-segmentation we can follow. Let me give you a few examples.<br><br> If you are a B2C business,
            if you’re selling to consumers, you can be an e-commerce business. That’s one sub-segment. You can be a
            mobile app like we discussed earlier, or a SaaS app. Or you can be just bricks and mortar. You can have a
            retail, physical presence. Let me give you an example comparing those sub-segments against each other. Which
            channels are most likely to succeed?<br><br> Let’s take B2C e-commerce, selling physical goods. If you
            succeed at all with ads, these are the channels that you will most likely succeed with, based on my
            experience having worked with a few dozen startups over the last couple years and talking to a bunch of
            other companies as well and figuring out what works for them. Most likely for B2C is going to be Instagram
            ads, content marketing, and a little bit of PR, public relations to kick start some of these organic
            efforts. So sponsoring influencers or getting affiliates. You can kind of bucket that partially into PR.
            Getting the word out through non-advertising or content means.<br><br> You might also succeed with Pinterest
            ads, Google adwords and Google shopping. We can dive into those individually, but right now I’m trying to
            give a high level overview of some channels, so you can have them in the back of your brain.<br><br> Let’s
            go to a couple other sub-segments that are most common. I won’t go through all of them just yet, but let’s
            say you are a B2C SaaS app. You’re selling software to consumers. An example of this would be Streak,
            s-t-r-e-a-k dot com. They are a Chrome extension that is also a SaaS app. What they do is they allow
            consumers, people like you and I, to send emails in a more organized fashion. That’s one way to think about
            it. They’re also for businesses as well. They will most likely succeed with Facebook ads and content
            marketing. And they might succeed with Google adwords and affiliate programs.<br><br> Let me give you one
            last example of a sub-segment in the B2B category, business to business, just so we can get the lay of the
            land of what channels are out there. Let me take a look here. Let’s say you are a broadly appealing B2B
            product with a high amount of revenue that you make<br><br> per user, which we call high average revenue per
            user. So ARPU. A company like that is one that might make $1000 per month per customer.<br><br> So maybe
            they’re something like SalesForce, perhaps. They’re software that target businesses. They charge a lot per
            month to big companies. If that is you, you’ll most likely succeed doing sales. That’s one of the key
            differences here. If you’re selling to businesses, you may have to rely less on ads and more so on
            traditional sales.<br><br> Sales can break down further into cold emailing, sending emails to people who
            you’ve never spoken to before. Traditional networking, say at conferences, and even sending cold LinkedIn
            messages as an alternative to cold emails. You can also rely on lead generation. Getting businesses that
            might be interested in your product, that’s what a lead would be. Someone who might be interested. You don’t
            yet know. They’re not yet a customer. You could do lead generation through Facebook ads and Google adwords.
            And you might succeed with Instagram ads as well, and content marketing.<br><br> I’m going to pause there.
            The idea being, there is a sort of framework here to think about what is most likely to work. When I say
            most likely, what I mean is not just a matter of every dollar in will come back out your way more
            profitably. It’s not just that. It’s also whether it can be made to work at all.<br><br> For example, sales
            will not work at all for many B2C companies that are selling toothbrushes, because the amount of labor that
            goes into a sales call or a sales email will be unjustifiably expensive, relative to how much revenue you
            make from the sale of that toothbrush. That is an example of how one channel might only be appropriate for
            one type of business.<br><br> Conversely, if you’re doing Snapchat ads, that channel might not be
            appropriate for SalesForce. Because Snapchat’s audience might be predominantly younger people who are in a
            frame of mind while using Snapchat that is not at all conducive to saying, “Yeah, what enterprise software
            should I sign my sales team up for?” There’s a contextual component.<br><br> There’s, does your audience
            even exist on that channel, component. Then there’s the financial component of assessing the channel. For
            example, is it simply too expensive to buy ads there, given how much money I make from my average user? Then
            putting ads aside entirely, you have things I alluded to like affiliate programs, PR, content marketing and
            a few other non-paid channels that we can get into if you’d like.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">OK. Great. That’s a lot of information to digest. I think it really
            gets the point across that there’s a lot to think about here. It’s not as simple as, “I’m going to build an
            app and it’s going to work.” You really should put thought into the different channels you can use and
            whether or not they’ll be profitable and workable for you in the short term and the long term. There’s a ton
            of different options.<br><br> Let’s say I am an aspiring Indie Hacker. I don’t know what I want to work on.
            I don’t know what I want to build yet. But I’m listening to this episode and I’m thinking, “Gee, I don’t
            want to pick the wrong thing that’s going to be a lot of trouble to grow and that’s not going to be
            successful at<br><br> all.” How would you think about being in that position, Julian? I know you say that
            e-commerce is better than SaaS. Should I start an e-commerce business as an aspiring Indie Hacker?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">There’s advice that’s out there which says, “Choose what you’re
            passionate about and solve problems that you have.” Meaning those are the criteria people often say should
            lead you to the type of business you start. The reason for the passion one is so that you sustain your
            motivation to see the business through.<br><br> The reason for the solving your own problem is so that you
            can be your own customer. Because when you’re your own customer, you have a better understanding of how to
            solve the problem more intimately. When you fail to solve the problem sufficiently, you can be a good judge
            of that.<br><br> It’s good advice, but I would argue it’s the wrong advice. This goes against much of what
            you would hear from other people. Having grown so many companies and having seen their struggles so early
            on, and having seen them pivot sometimes on account of the recommendations my agency, Bell Curve, has made
            to them when seeing their struggles, I believe that in contrast you should start with what is most likely to
            succeed.<br><br> And succeed meaning profitably, whatever your milestone is for being happy financially,
            that is what I mean by succeed. I’m not saying go choose the idea most likely to make a billion dollars, if
            you don’t care about that. Whatever would make you happy, realistically. If it’s a lifestyle business that
            maybe pays what you would have been paid had you worked for someone else and that’s what you’re looking for,
            awesome. Start with what is most likely to achieve that. The way that you assess that is by figuring out
            what is most suitable for growth. We’ll get back to that in a moment.<br><br> But the second step is, once
            you’ve identified that, then you ask yourself, “OK, within those possibilities, within all those things that
            I think are likely to succeed, what am I most passionate about? Which of these do I have the problem they’re
            solving?” Those should be criteria for narrowing down the top-level criterion of what’s actually going to
            work.<br><br> Because I don’t care how passionate you are about an idea. If it’s failing miserably for half
            a year, you will feel miserable. You will give up. It will have been a poor use of your time. I really want
            to stress that. Don’t work on something doomed to fail, because there is an infinite amount of ideas you
            could be pursuing. To pursue the one you’re most passionate about and disregard the growth potential of it,
            is doing yourself a disservice and is being naïve. Because I guarantee there is an idea out there that is
            both. You are both passionate about it and it has growth potential.<br><br> To kind of wrap this up, how do
            you assess whether something has growth potential? Meaning, how can you get it to a point where it’s
            sustaining the financial lifestyle you want without too much friction? Essentially you want to look at the
            data of what types of companies succeed most frequently, which is how we started off this call.<br><br> So
            e-commerce does succeed more frequently, controlling for founder skill and the quality of the idea, more so
            than software. You also want to look for how big is the market? How badly does the market want what you’re
            offering? And if you can find specific examples, if there are competitors that exist that are doing great,
            that is a very good thing. That shouldn’t scare you.<br><br> You shouldn’t say, “Too much competition.” The
            world is huge. The population is growing quickly. The amount of people in countries with quickly increasing
            purchasing power and with access to the internet is rapidly expanding. So it doesn’t matter if competition
            exists. There’s a reason why there’s a half-dozen mattress companies popping up every year, or every quarter
            even. They all do get a small piece of the pie.<br><br> Remember, if you’re not trying to be a billionaire
            by this idea, you don’t need to have something that dominates the market. Competition is not a bad thing.
            The point I’m getting to here is, it is actually a great signal that the thing you’ve identified at the
            intersection of what you’re passionate about, what you understand, you understand the problem that’s being
            solved, and has growth potential, that can be assessed by that signal. Are other people kicking butt doing
            it? Specifically, you can identify this in a couple of ways.<br><br> One, you can go to <a
                href="http://alexa.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">Alexa.com</a>, a-l-e-x-a dot com. Scroll
            halfway down the page, at least at the time of this recording. Enter the domain name of that competitor.
            You’ll be able to see the traffic trend that they’re received over time, so over the last year for example.
            It will show you how many more visitors they’ve had in one month versus the next. Typically, not always, but
            typically, if you see that steadily increasing it means they’re buying more and more traffic. Usually
            through ads, or maybe it’s word of mouth.<br><br> If that trend holds, then it means they’re probably doing
            pretty well. Because each month they’re being more motivated to keep pumping more money in, because when
            they put a dollar in they get more than a dollar back. That’s one sign of finding out, “Are they successful?
            Or are they just blasting you with ads and they seem successful, but they’re going to be going out of
            business?” Again, this is not a perfect metric but it is a place to start.<br><br> Another one is, like
            their Facebook page and look at the level of engagement on their Facebook ads. Is it a ghost town, or are
            people truly engaging? Is the number of engagements, likes, comments, shares just exploding over
            time?<br><br> There’s a few metrics that you can use as a proxy to assess their success. The reason I’m
            spending so much time on this point is because, much like the growth marketing mindset as a whole, you want
            to be data-oriented. You don’t want to go off hunches, ever. Hunches can propose some things for you to try,
            but data should then be what validates them. Hunches should not be what concludes on experiments or
            concludes on really important decisions.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like that you bring up this point about hunches. It’s so easy when
            you’re listening to other people’s stories or doing research to fall prey to survivorship bias, where you
            say, “I see all sorts of people who say that they followed a hunch, and it worked out for their business.”
            But you’re not really looking at all the people who followed a hunch and that growth strategy didn’t work
            out, and their business failed. They never really wrote about it. So<br><br> you really should take the
            denominator into account and consider the possibility that, just because you see something very often
            doesn’t necessarily mean that it has a high percentage chance of success.<br><br> The opposite is also true.
            You might very rarely see people talk about making these data-driven decisions that you’re talking about,
            but that doesn’t change the fact that it might be a more successful approach.<br><br> Can you give us any
            stories or examples of times where you’ve used these strategies like looking at <a href="http://alexa.com"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">Alexa.com</a> or examining another company’s Facebook ads, and come up
            with a good growth strategy for yourself or for a company that you’ve worked with?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. Let me give you a counter-example, a different way to think about
            how to identify the right direction for your product, beyond just looking at competitors.<br><br> If you
            start out with a test. Let’s say you have a product that does a lot of things. It helps you get money back
            from companies that have wronged you, so maybe a restaurant spilled food on your clothing, right? Maybe you
            bought a toaster that broke while on warranty and the company will not refund you or exchange it.<br><br>
            The reason I’m giving you this example is because that is exactly a client that we work with, Service. Or
            Get Service. They started as a product that did exactly that. They were basically customer support as a
            service. They brokered customer support conversations for you. They didn’t really have a monetization
            strategy that was solid just yet. They were exploring the market, which is an OK thing if you’re very
            diligent with your growth.<br><br> They were looking for the signs in those early tests, of which types of
            customer complaints had the highest affinity, meaning when that problem or when that complaint occurred,
            customers were really passionate about seeing it through. About getting it resolved. And they were willing
            to put up with anything to get to a conclusion. That would be high affinity.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That’s exactly right. And that can be an OK thing. Just doing growth
            modestly, meaning not spending too much money, temporarily for the purpose of learning more about your
            market and the problems you should be solving based on what is going to succeed, growth-wise, that is OK to
            do. They did that. They found one particular use case that was by far and away the winner.<br><br> Then I
            said to them, “Why don’t you double down on that now? Because if we focus your product where the only thing
            it does is just that one complaint resolution, it’s going to give us an<br><br> opportunity to focus our
            growth efforts.” Meaning our website, our ads, the in-app experience because it’s a mobile app, all of that
            can be very narrowly tailored to that use case.<br><br> That use case, by the way, is what’s called flight
            remuneration, which is where if a flight is delayed by an airline or cancelled, depending on a few
            stipulations, you may be entitled to a cash back, like mileage back. So that was the thing that ticked off
            consumers the most, because no one likes a delayed flight, right? When that problem occurred, people felt a
            lot of anger toward the airlines. Their affinity was through the roof. That was the type of person we knew
            would fall in love with our app if we could solve their problem.<br><br> So we redirected all of our growth
            efforts, doubled down on exactly that, and went from spending almost nothing on ads, because we weren’t
            making money and there wasn’t enough focus, to spending more per month on Facebook and Instagram advertising
            combined than any other client I had ever worked with before.<br><br> Because it turned out, it hit a lot of
            those things that I mentioned a few moments ago. It hit a lot of those criteria you should be looking for to
            assess whether your idea will succeed from a growth perspective. I’ll go into those in a moment. But it was
            only because we afforded ourselves that learning period that we had the data to be extra confident we would
            then head in the right direction. We didn’t need a competitor to tell us this. We had our own data. So
            sometimes you can go with internal data.<br><br> Really briefly, why did that idea succeed? The market’s
            huge. Everybody flies. At least everyone in the geographies that we’re targeting, North America. They get in
            an airplane and fly perhaps, on average, once or twice a year. And there’s a whole bunch of people, business
            travelers who travel so frequently they would kill for our app. Because they would be getting so many
            hundreds of dollars back, no exaggeration. Or thousands back, based on all the times they’ve been wronged by
            the airlines. The market is simply huge.<br><br> And the affinity, like we already spoke about, is high,
            which means the market demand is high even though it’s latent demand. Meaning people weren’t saying, “Hey,
            why doesn’t someone build an app for me to go ahead and get money back from the airlines?” Because no one
            knew that was a thing that could even be done before Service blew up and everyone started learning about
            it.<br><br> Demand doesn’t only have to be what is on the tip of people’s tongues, which would mean they
            already know about the solution you provide, which was not the case. It might just mean, once they learn
            about you they’re going to go crazy for you. That is OK demand as well. In fact, that is hidden demand or
            latent demand that usually makes for the most explosive businesses.<br><br> Airbnb, nobody knew people
            wanted that, for years. But there’s no reason why it could not have existed 40 years ago. There’s no reason.
            Perhaps the lack of the internet, but from an actual usage perspective, going to someone’s home and so
            forth, that could have been done through a mail-order catalog. Who knows? It could have existed. There was a
            latent demand, and it took data tests that the Airbnb team did, just like the Service team did. The same
            methodology to use their own data to figure out, “OK, you know what? There’s something here that no one
            else<br><br> realized.” Which means not only do I have a market play here, because the growth potential is
            real, but there isn’t a single competitor that currently exists. So if I play my growth right, I might be
            the next biggest thing. Service became exactly that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like that you said that one of the criteria here is that the market
            is huge. Everybody flies. Everybody has to deal with delayed or canceled flights. So the potential number of
            customers that this company could reach is humungous.<br><br> People talk a lot about product/market fit. It
            gets misinterpreted by a lot of people starting companies as “I need to make something that people really
            like.” That’s great and all. You should make something that people really like. But you also need to make
            something that a lot of people can potentially use. The market you’re targeting has to be huge. It has to be
            a market where people actually pay money for things. How do you research to figure out which markets are
            worth targeting?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I would think a bit less about markets and a bit more about audiences.
            One might say, “How big is the market for flight remuneration?” You’re like, “Ah, I don’t know.” It’s not
            really a thing.<br><br> But if you said, “How big is the audience of people who might want that?” it’s like,
            “Well, technically let’s add all the frequent business flyers and the more casual vacation goers.” Then we
            might have an idea of how can we break that down by affinity? Who would want us the most within that
            audience?<br><br> So if you look at the highest affinity, probably the business travelers because they deal
            with this problem the most. That’s affinity based on frequency. If that’s the case, or – for a point of
            contrast, I would contrast affinity based on frequency versus affinity based on magnitude. Meaning when this
            type of audience or sub-audience experiences the problem, how bad is it? There are different ways to break
            down an audience.<br><br> The point being, if you start with the audience, segment by affinity, then you can
            ask yourself, “How large is the audience that would want me the most?” That is typically how you want to
            think about whether the quote-unquote market is good for you. There’s a few other hidden components which
            are sort of self-evident but I want to tease them out.<br><br> Is what you’re doing actually successfully
            solving their problem? Is what you’re doing the sort of thing that can be conveyed very succinctly and
            effectively to people? You might have the world’s best problem, but if your approach to it cannot be
            digested into a really powerful punchy ad that gets people to click, then this might not be a very effective
            solution. At least from the perspective of growth, which as I’ve been arguing is kind of the most important
            thing. Growth is another way of saying, “Does your business function? Is it even capable of
            self-sustaining?” That’s how I would normally think of it.<br><br> To answer your question more directly, if
            I’m trying to identify a business opportunity, “What should my next business be?” which I think is the real
            question, I would go back to that framework of, “What is likely to succeed?” Service succeeds not just
            because the market is huge,<br><br> or because the affinity can sometimes be very high. It also succeeds
            because it can pass that test of being conveyed and being pitched very efficiently.<br><br> We have one ad
            that we call a hero ad. Meaning it by far and away out-performs every other ad we’ve ever made for Service.
            All it say is, “PS, airlines will pay you up to 135 bucks when your flight is delayed or canceled.” Period.
            That is the entire ad. There is no other text on the image. That is responsible for seven figures in ad
            spend. Had I tried spending seven figures with a lesser ad, it probably would not have been
            profitable.<br><br> My point here is, assessing the viability of your idea is not just a matter of assessing
            the market. It’s a matter of assessing how well can you pitch it, and does it really solve the problem? And
            a few other things. I’ll give you one last item here, which is Service also made it a no-brainer to sign up.
            Not only was the pitch effective in the sense that, “Here’s what we’re doing,” and you’re like, “Damn, I
            need that solved.” But once you download the mobile app, you weren’t charged anything.<br><br> The value
            proposition, meaning what they were pitching to you as what they were going to do for you was, “Hey, create
            an account. Put your credit card on file. That’s it. We’re not going to charge it. We’re going to do
            everything we can for free to go and try to talk to the airlines and get you money back. If we succeed, then
            we’ll take a portion of what we get you back. So you have nothing to lose here.” And that was the genius of
            Service’s business model.<br><br> That is, in fact, my last point, which is how compelling is the way you
            solve the problem? Not just can it be conveyed well, which I gave you the example of the ad. But do you
            actually solve the problem in a way that people go, “Wow. Yes. Sign me up for that. I don’t perceive any
            friction here. Go.”</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">These are my two most reliable frameworks for deciding whether you
            should pursue an idea or perhaps more so, finding an idea you should pursue. First from the B2B side, when
            you’re looking to sell something to businesses. You should be the buyer. You should see the problem and have
            it yourself.<br><br> You should go and talk to your own business and say, “Would you guys pay to solve this
            problem?” If so, others may be willing to pay for it. Go survey similar companies and find out. Get a whole
            bunch of yeses before you venture into building something. That’s a very tried and true framework. Nothing
            novel on my part there.<br><br> The one that’s a bit more novel on my part is identifying e-commerce trends
            where branding is the differentiator.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Let’s look at Instagram data. As often as I can I’ll try to bring this
            back to some sort of source of data. Things trend on Instagram. There are hash tags. There are third-party
            tools that let you assess what’s being discussed the most, month over month on Instagram based on hash
            tags.<br><br> If you see beauty products, makeup, skin care, whatever, trending really strong, meaning
            there’s a new trend in there. Maybe it’s using a certain type of powder or using a certain type of medical
            ingredient in skin cream, and it’s really starting to get some traction, that might be an indication that
            will explode soon. You might want to jump the gun early and be there from day one.<br><br> How do you assess
            that? You then go to Google trends. Literally just go to Google and type “Google trends” and you’ll be
            brought to a dashboard where you enter the name of that trend. Google will show you a graph over time of how
            many people search for that keyword or that thing, that trend, month over month. If that’s spiking up, much
            like the Alexa graph example from earlier, if people are searching this thing more and more and more, then
            it might be on the precipice of exploding. If you’re there from day one, you might be the one that wins the
            branding war. You own that category in the minds of all of the people who would be in your market.<br><br>
            Another way to look at that, a different perspective into how to choose an e-commerce product, is you can
            find something that is boring, old, perhaps even overplayed. Like everyone in the world has a mattress, some
            form of mattress. At least everyone in North America is going to have a mattress. So you might think to
            yourself, “You know what? There’s nothing to be done here. I can’t bring something new to
            mattresses.”<br><br> That very often isn’t true because branding alone can sometimes be the differentiator.
            There are people selling the Quip toothbrush, or I’m sure there’s a whole bunch of others. The idea here is,
            how differentiated are they really? How differentiated is one modern toothbrush from the next? Is it just
            prettier? Probably. Is it a little bit cheaper? Probably. Is it a little bit easier to buy the one
            personalized to you based on their website functionality? Probably.<br><br> None of those things are game
            changers. But you add up those small things together, it feels modern. You then paint a brand story around
            it. Like, this is the thing where it’s going to make your teeth better than they’ve ever been. You show
            people ecstatic about it. You show all the social proof. You show other customers’ testimonials. You build
            this bubble that you trap people in, where they think you are the new hottest thing. Then the next time they
            have to buy a new toothbrush, they’ll choose you instead of going to the local pharmacy.<br><br> That I have
            seen become the only differentiator. Branding, positioning, for many companies that have succeeded wildly
            recently. I don’t want to encourage a lot of people to think that way, because I think it’s bad for the
            marketplace. I think it will burn out. I think unless you know branding really well, you won’t actually see
            much success. But if you’re a branding expert and you’re not a coder who can make a SaaS app or something,
            it is an honestly good option available to you.</p>

            I’ve seen various Indie Hackers use to their success. Influencer marketing, getting popular or famous people
            to talk about what you’re building. Ranking high in app stores, so you mentioned Chrome extensions. Most
            people find Chrome extensions through the Chrome app store or the Chrome web store, or mobile apps it’s the
            same thing. Public speaking. Some businesses grow tremendously through their founders’ public speaking. Some
            businesses that doesn’t make any sense at all.<br><br> How can I as a founder go about evaluating these sort
            of slower, more gradual channels to determine what’s going to be best for my business?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The only way to assess those typically is to just do them. It’s less
            about how can I tell whether they’re going to work quickly, how do I assess them? More so about how do you
            distribute your resources efficiently? Meaning how can you run small tests in each of those channels in
            parallel, as early as you can? Especially the ones that take a long time to pay dividends, to actually work,
            like SEO.<br><br> You plant all of these seeds. If ads fail you can go back to the plants and the trees that
            have grown out of those seeds over time. Start networking. Start doing a little bit of PR here and there. It
            does serve a purpose at times, at least for the average company, I mean. In general it serves a purpose.
            Sometimes it can be pretty interesting for comparing it with ads. Just don’t let anything that takes a long
            time to snowball and build momentum, go unaddressed for too long.<br><br> In fact that is the exact same
            strategy I use for all of Bell Curve’s growth clients from the ads channel front. Even just focusing on
            those channels where you do have to pay money. We run very small tests in each, like 500 to 1,000 dollars,
            which is small for them. Because these are usually companies that have raised several million. We try to
            find out very quickly, does this channel, do Snapchat ads have potential? If not, we’ll stop and we’ll come
            back to it at a later time. But we want to know early on, because if it turns out that Snapchat is a quarter
            of the price of Instagram, and we only tested Instagram, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.<br><br>
            Sometimes that reduction in paid acquisition cost can single-handedly be what makes or breaks your business.
            So the real methodology here is, go in with an open mind. Figure out what is the quickest way I can validate
            this particular channel? With paid channels it means spending a little bit of money, being very thoughtful
            about the audiences you’re testing. With unpaid channels, it depends very much on a per-channel basis. I’m
            not an expert in, say, conferences and PR. But with content marketing one example of doing a small test
            would be something like doing keyword analysis, which is a whole different topic we probably won’t get
            into.<br><br> But if you Google something like keyword analysis for my blog, you’ll be able to figure out
            what are people searching for. Then you can just start by writing blog posts of the things that are most
            commonly searched for, that other people are not writing much about. Make it easy on yourself and see, “OK,
            people who do come and read these blog posts, that should get a decent amount of visitors. Do they actually
            wind up converting into customers?”<br><br> One more point there on blogging, which is: it’s not just a
            matter of, “Will this get enough traffic, relatively speaking?” But, “Is this a topic I could write about
            that would segue naturally into a pitch for my product?” You can write about all sorts of stuff, but if it
            doesn’t usher people toward a sale, you have to think about what its value is versus trying a different
            topic, for the purposes of assessing content marketing as a channel in an efficient manner. Put yourself in
            the best possible position to win in these channel tests.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like your emphasis on testing. You keep using the word testing. I
            think for people learning how to build a company from scratch, we see these examples of other companies that
            have succeeded. We only really see what worked in the end. They say, “I put up this type of ad,” or “I
            started doing this type of link building strategy,” or “I reached out to these influencers, and my website
            blew up.” But oftentimes, those people tried dozens of things that didn’t work beforehand, and they were
            just very efficient about ruling out what wasn’t going to work and have gone to the next thing.<br><br> I
            want to ask you some specific questions around topics that we talk about a lot on the Indie Hackers podcast
            and see how you would approach those from a position of growth. The first is, how would you go about
            creating a small to moderately sized e-commerce business quickly? People listening in might be saying, “OK,
            I’m sold. E-commerce might be the way to go.” What’s your road map? What would you do first and what can
            other people learn from that?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Let me first tie back to something I said earlier in the chat, which is
            I want to substantiate why is e-commerce better than SaaS? At least the frequency of it succeeding
            financially or profitably. With e-commerce, typically you’re selling a good like a toothbrush or a mattress
            that people are already buying. Think about that for a moment. If I’m creating SaaS software in contrast, is
            the average person in America, is the average adult already buying a tool to allow them to live chat with
            business customers on their website and get analytics for the live chats? That’s a very niche thing.<br><br>
            When you’re selling a niche thing, particularly through the lens of growth, meaning you’re pitching it to
            someone through an ad, a niche thing has to be explained from multiple levels of a ladder of product
            awareness. Number one, why do I have to solve this problem? “Oh, because when you have chats with people on
            your website, X, Y and Z.” In explaining the problem, you’ve now taken up half or more of the real estate
            available to you in your ad to pitch why your solution is amazing.<br><br> Let’s compare that back to
            e-commerce. If everyone knows what a toothbrush is and I run an ad pitching a toothbrush, all I have to do
            is point out why mine is amazing. I can just show how pretty it is. I can show a couple of its cool
            features. I can bullet point one, two, three, this is why it is awesome. I don’t have to pitch the problem
            of why somebody needs a toothbrush or a mattress. They already know.<br><br> You can more efficiently use
            real estate. And running as many ads as I have, I know full well that efficiency is the key to ads. You have
            to get to the point quickly. If you ramble too much, people stop reading. People don’t click, and then it’s
            very expensive to run ads profitably. So this is a huge component.<br><br> The second component is the flip
            side of this coin, which is if people already buy this thing, it means they’re going to buy it again. Just a
            matter of how expendable is that good. They’re already going to want to buy it no matter what. If you show
            your ad to them at a point in their life when they’re ready to buy, you have an extremely good chance to get
            that sale. Part of the hustle of growth marketing, running ads competently, what we do for clients, is we
            figure out how do we most narrowly identify those individuals who do in fact need that good right now in
            their life. What are the signals? What are the patterns or behaviors that correlate with someone about to
            buy a mattress?<br><br> I’ll give you a specific example. On Facebook they allow you to do something called
            behavioral targeting. That means you can target your ads to people on Facebook based on the behaviors
            Facebook detects in them. One such behavior might be they recently moved. They went from New York to
            California. That is a perfect example of what I would call a trigger for introducing someone into our ideal
            audience of buying a mattress. When you move, if you’re not trucking your mattress across the country,
            you’re going to have to buy one. There we go. Sure enough, that will out-perform just generally targeting
            all Facebook users as a second type of ad set. An ad set is sort of the means by which you target someone on
            Facebook. It will always perform better.<br><br> Just wanted to tie all that up together before I answer
            your question of why is e-commerce awesome. Those are two reasons. Maybe I’ll rapid-fire a couple more off
            the top of my head, just because I think people are interested in this. Because I’ve spoken so much about
            why e-commerce, why e-commerce.<br><br> It’s visual. Usually people also have a price expectation. People
            have an idea that for a mattress they’re going to be spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Now for a
            SaaS app in contrast, they usually use what’s called value-based pricing. Because there’s no actual concrete
            marginal cost that is in the hundreds of dollars when trying to sell something that’s software based,
            usually. So they’re like, “Let’s just charge 500 bucks because we think it provides that much value to our
            customer. So we can get away with it because they’ll be happy paying it.”<br><br> That’s, however, purely
            conjecture. Or maybe that’s substantiated by some user tests you’ve run. But the point is, you simply don’t
            know if people really put their money where their mouth is and say, “Yes. That I’m willing to pay. That’s as
            much value as I theoretically get from that software.” In comparison to e-commerce, if you are selling a
            mattress and one of your key selling points is that you cost $400 as opposed to $3,000 for an extremely
            premium mattress, people are like, “Wow. I know for sure that’s how much a mattress costs normally. So I
            know for sure you’re giving me the deal of a lifetime. And I have no problem paying your $400.”<br><br> I
            can go on and on about why e-commerce is awesome. This is not something, by the way, that almost anyone that
            I’ve spoken to in the entirety of Silicon Valley, other than investors who are savvy enough to figure this
            out and double down on it, even know about or talk about, ever. It’s never spoken.<br><br> I think part of
            that has to do with, a lot of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, in San Francisco, in northern California
            and elsewhere, there’s a heavy emphasis on technical founders. When you’re a coder founder and you’re trying
            to follow this advice and solve your own problem,<br><br> usually the problems you have are software
            related. Or your reflex when solving a problem is to ask yourself, “How can I use software to do so?” None
            of that is conducive to coming up with e-commerce ideas.<br><br> E-commerce is also sort of dismissed as a
            sort of non-sexy, archaic, Costco level warehousing thing. Plus the logistics of shipping things across the
            country can be very intimidating. Fortunately, however, falsely intimidating. Because there are tons of full
            solution providers that will do all of that for you.<br><br> One last note on this is, there is a part of
            North America that’s crushing e-commerce. That’s Los Angeles. They’re sort of like, Hollywood first, brand
            first, marketing first, Instagram, social influencers, celebrities. All that stuff fosters an environment
            where e-commerce is better supported. Emotionally, data-wise, what your friends are doing, what investors
            are looking for. If you go look at the startups coming out of LA, how many of them are selling physical
            goods, it’s relatively high. People don’t realize this. And very successful. Super high rate of success.
            Something to chew on.</p>

            people we talk to or cities we live in, who are doing things a totally different way.<br><br> I think that’s
            one of the cool things about talking to somebody like you who runs an agency, or talking to an investor.
            Because people in those positions, you guys see a lot of companies from all over the place. You don’t get

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Great question. When you’re going niche, let’s say you’re targeting
            people who love widgets, there are a few ways to leverage the popular social networks to find widget lovers.
            This is important, because if you’re just targeting a quarter million people<br><br> who would be the
            perfect fit for your product, if you try advertising on Facebook just very broadly where there’s over a
            billion people and over 200 million in the US alone, something around that, it’s going to be wildly
            inefficient ad spend. You’ll be targeting and spamming everyone.<br><br> If you look at Twitter, they have
            something very cool. You can target Twitter users based on who Twitter users follow. Those are very niche
            signals. If I follow Widgetco or Widget fans or Widget photos, that’s a pretty strong sign that I care about
            widgets.<br><br> On Facebook you can target people based on the pages that they like. However, many pages,
            particularly those with smaller audiences, who have been liked less frequently, or to a smaller degree,
            Facebook will simply not allow you to target them at all. But Twitter gives you that full, unfettered access
            to even the most niche of things, based on the accounts people follow. Further, Twitter can be used to
            target keywords. So if someone’s publicly tweeting about widgets, you can target people who’ve entered those
            keywords into their tweets. Pretty cool.<br><br> The downside is, Twitter is one of the worst ad channels.
            It’s usually worse performing than Facebook, Instagram, even Snapchat. Meaning the cost per click to your
            website is very high. People’s intent to buy once they reach your website is pretty poor. But if that’s the
            only place you can identify your audience, it’s going to be probably your best channel.<br><br> Also SEO.
            Piggybacking off of keywords like widget, when people Google that you can have blog posts that cover what’s
            called the full long tail. All of the niche topics that all aggregate together to be a meaningful number of
            topics. You can cover those in individual blog posts. Even people searching at very small amounts per month,
            maybe you can dominate that in aggregate.<br><br> One more thing I’ll say on this, because I want to try to
            rapid-fire these better than I am. Sorry about that. But in regard to Facebook, they have something called
            look alike targeting. Which is where, as long as you have some people already visiting your website and
            engaging and buying, without you having to do anything technical, you can instruct Facebook through their
            dashboard how to target people who have the same sort of demographic and purchasing behaviors as the people
            on your website. They can identify similar people and extrapolate backwards from there. Very cool. Extremely
            effective.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Virality does work. It can work. It probably will not work for your
            product. Let me be more specific. There are a few types of virality.<br><br> There’s inherent virality,
            which occurs as a natural function of your product’s day to day use. For example, if you’re paying someone
            on PayPal, your payment’s recipient needs to fist join PayPal in order to get that payment, right? So who’s
            not going to sign up to get paid? It’s an extremely<br><br> compelling offer in your email inbox. “Hey, sign
            up and you can get your friend’s thousand dollars that he’s paying you.” So no wonder PayPal’s user base
            exploded.<br><br> That’s inherent virality occurring as a function of your product’s everyday use. That is
            the best virality there is, because you don’t have to introduce artificial gimmicks like, “Here’s ten
            percent off. Here’s 25 bucks. Here’s some swag.” You don’t have to rely on that stuff, which never works as
            well as an inherently compelling reason for someone to go ahead and sign up for the product. And because one
            person will pay more than one recipient in a year, usually, it’s one to many.<br><br> Let’s use Dropbox as
            another great example of inherent virality. In order for me to use Dropbox in my business, I have to share
            it with my whole team. That’s step one. Step two, when I want to then share a Dropbox file with people
            outside of the team, a client or something, I may have to invite them. Now they have to sign up. That’s
            inherent virality. That’s the best. It doesn’t have to be incentivized. It works organically. No surprise
            Gmail, Hotmail, PayPal, Airbnb, Dropbox all exploded. Those are all examples of inherent virality.<br><br>
            Word of mouth is a second type. You guys know what that is. Basically just focus on building a product
            experience where people are overjoyed and want to, on their own volition, proactively recommend your
            product. I think that’s a conversation for another podcast. Product experience. So I’ll skip past
            that.<br><br> Next is artificial virality. That is the sort of contrived reward systems, getting cash or
            access for referring others. Everyone’s trying this. Every app I’ve ever used. “Hey, get 25% off. Hey, get a
            month free. Hey, get 25 bucks back.” Here’s the problem with that. I want to spend just a moment on
            that.<br><br> This artificial virality is a matter of moving the focus off of why people are using your
            product. That is a bad thing. Every single part of your customer’s journey should be doubled down on, “Hey,
            use the product more and get more value out of it.” Not “Here’s me paying you because I don’t know how to
            get you to invite other people organically or inherently.” So I guess the first point is, try to avoid it as
            your only means of referral if you have better options like inherent or word of mouth.<br><br> If you are
            going to do it, here’s how I would do it. Either offer a huge bounty, like get the product for free if I
            refer five friends. That’s much more tangible than, “Get five dollars.” I don’t need some fraction of
            minimum wage. That’s not why I signed up for your service. But if you tell me that I get a free lunch, that
            gets more people to take action, including wealthy people.<br><br> There’s some sort of a weird
            psychological trick at play there. Even though it’s not even worth and extremely wealthy person’s time.
            Let’s say there’s some billionaire. If you tell them, “Hey, you get this thing for free. Just don’t be lazy.
            All you have to do is invite three people,” you shift the emphasis of the reward system away from, “Here’s
            money,” to “Don’t be lazy. You can do yourself a huge favor.” Which is get this for free. “If you just
            invite three friends.”<br><br> It’s an interesting perspective shift there that circumvents wealth class and
            gets more people to take action. In summary, offer a huge bounty where it becomes free. Whatever that thing
            is for some amount of time. Usually to financially justify that on your end as the product offering
            something for free, you’ll want to figure out how many people does this person have to refer, for it to be
            profitable for me to then give it to them for free?<br><br> There’s much more to say but I’ll stop there.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Another question that came up a few times on Twitter is about emerging
            or futuristic channels. The idea here is that, as more and more people know about a channel like, say,
            Facebook ads, they use it more thus driving up the price of Facebook ads and making it a less effective
            channel. Are there any tips that you have for how to find new and emerging channels that are promising? Do
            any particular channels come to mind?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Any time a social network is gaining traction, it is almost a given
            that they will introduce some sort of ad platform. That is the primary way to monetize a social network, is
            to introduce ads. Tinder sure enough at some point introduced ads. All of its competitors have or
            will.<br><br> So when you’re looking at those nascent social networks that aren’t as big as Facebook or
            Snapchat, if you can get on their ad platforms the moment they release them, subscribe to their blogs,
            create a Google alert. Go to Google, literally Google the phrase “Google alerts.” You’ll be able to set up
            little email notifications any time there’s news about these companies. Make an alert for, like, Snapchat
            ads or Tinder ads or whatever product has yet to release an ad platform. Get on there as early as you
            can.<br><br> I was on Quora super early, and was able to take advantage of the fact that no one else was
            advertising on Quora. That is the first emerging channel I’ll share with you guys. That’s worth playing
            around with. There’s also Snapchat is not an emerging product, nor an emerging ad platform per se, but it is
            getting much better as an ad channel. So is Pinterest.<br><br> They’re emerging in the sense that they’re
            now performing OK, whereas in the earlier days neither performed that well. When I say perform, I mean they
            simply were very hard to make profitable or they were hard to get people to actually go ahead and buy from
            you once they clicked through to the ad. Point being, not only do you want to look for new channels. You
            want to periodically assess old ones, because they have hundreds of people spending the majority of their
            days doing nothing but trying to improve the performance of their ad platforms. So give Pinterest and
            Snapchat another shot.<br><br> There are some of these audio platforms like Spotify, Pandora and so worth,
            which are releasing ad platforms. Give those a whirl. I know Spotify recently introduced ads. In terms of
            other upcoming, nascent ones – I’ll pause there. I want to rapid fire these. What else?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Mobile apps. Yeah. Here’s an incredibly high leverage piece of advice.
            Most people running mobile app advertising direct traffic directly to the App Store or Google Play
            store.<br><br> That might work best, but usually what works better, meaning if you do what I’m about to
            suggest you will see people purchase at a much higher rate. Your install rate will go down but those who
            actually do install will purchase more, meaning your actual revenue will go higher, which is what matters.
            Or your profit. If you do the following, which is put a landing page in between the ad and the App
            Store.<br><br> A landing page just means a website, a page. So people click on the ad, they go to your
            website. The website links them to the App Store. That, in all of my client tests, has drastically improved
            performance. The reason for that, one, the Play Store or the App Store, the actual pages in the stores don’t
            do a very good job holistically and convincingly pitching your product. The creative is minimal. There’s not
            much room to play with there. The copy, meaning the text of the description, is very minimal and not fun to
            read. Just a wall of text, right? And by creative a moment ago, what I mean by creative is the imagery and
            the videos.<br><br> If you have a website instead, you can do your full normal pitch. You can show off
            videos. You can show off an interactive walkthrough. You can have really pretty, stylized text in small
            digestible chunks. It can be everything they need to know, so by the time they get into your app they
            actually buy from you.<br><br> Whereas if they just go to the App Store, it’s so boring and they’re so used
            to skipping past App Store pages anyway that they skim them entirely, that by the time they get into your
            app, they actually know nothing about your app. They just know the broad category, it helps me learn how to
            play guitar or something. But they don’t know any of the specific features that warrant them actually buying
            your product. But when you have that page interstitial, a landing page in between, you give them that pitch.
            Because they are going to skip reading the App Store page.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Same way you would do e-commerce. It seems like kind of a generic
            boring question. It’s actually a great question because it gives me the opportunity to tell everyone that
            which ad channel you use to identify your target audience doesn’t matter very much.<br><br> Here’s what I
            mean by that. Our best performing ad for one of our big enterprise B2B clients, they sell $50,000 machine
            learning computers. Their best performing ad is an Instagram ad of a computer with doggy ears on it. Which
            is super counter-intuitive, right? Because you’re thinking to yourself, “OK. B2B. So maybe we’ve got to
            target business people. Maybe we’ve got to target<br><br> them on LinkedIn. That’s where business people
            hang out and LinkedIn has an ad channel. Or maybe I’ve got to do sales.”<br><br> And maybe sales and
            LinkedIn do work, but the point is that as long as you’re targeting the right person on Instagram, it
            doesn’t matter that you’re using Instagram to target them. The platform, meaning Instagram ads, is just a
            conduit to get to the people who you know to be the best audience fit for you. If you’re setting up your
            Instagram ads to target people who do really want to buy a machine learning computer, because let’s say you
            figure out a way to target using that criteria, using Facebook’s dashboard, which is possible, that’s all
            that matters. Because a person is a person is a person.<br><br> If I’m a machine learning buyer and I’m on
            Instagram or I’m on LinkedIn, it doesn’t matter. I’m still the same person. The context of my usage of the
            individual social network, whether I use it for business or for personal reasons like Instagram, will not
            significantly affect my likelihood to respond to a business-to-business or business-to-consumer ad. That is
            a huge learning we found early on in Bell Curve, when we were working with B2B clients. It holds true across
            every channel and not just Instagram.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Great question. I’ll give you two. First would be, video ads almost
            always out-perform image ads. If you can attract people’s eyes when they’re scrolling through their feed, do
            it.<br><br> Another one I’ll give you is, demographics do actually respond differently to different selling
            points. A man in his 40s might respond significantly better – and when I say respond, of course I mean click
            through at a higher rate and all that stuff with the ad – to one type of message, than a woman who’s
            younger.<br><br> This might seem really self-evident but I’ve looked at a lot of ad accounts and I’ve never
            once seen a client – I really don’t think I’ve ever seen it before. Other than after we’ve come in and
            changed things – who’s segmented out demographics for the purpose of giving them the ads that are most
            appropriate for them. Those ads should then lead to landing pages, which is a fancy growth way of saying
            pages on your website, that are themselves tailored to that demographic. Think about the full journey of
            each person you’re targeting. Think about them as separate people, too.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Thank you, Julian.<br><br> If you enjoyed listening to this
            conversation and you want a really easy way to support the podcast, why don’t you head over to iTunes and
            leave us a quick rating or even a review? If you’re looking for an easy way to get there, just go to <a
                href="http://indiehackers.com/review" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/review</a> and
            that should open up iTunes on your computer. I read pretty much all the reviews that you guys leave over
            there, and it really helps other people to discover the show, so your support is very much
            appreciated.<br><br> In addition, if you are running your own internet business or if that’s something you
            hope to do someday, you should join me and a whole bunch of other founders on the <a
                href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a> website. It’s a
            great place to get feedback on pretty much any problem or question that you might have while running your
            business.<br><br> If you listen to the show, you know that I am a huge proponent of getting help from other
            founders rather than trying to build your business all by yourself. So you’ll see me on the forum for sure
            as well as more than a handful of some of the guests that I’ve had on the podcast.<br><br> If you’re looking
            for inspiration, we’ve also got a huge directory full of hundreds of products built by other Indie Hackers,
            every one of which includes revenue numbers and some of the behind-the-scenes strategies for how they grew
            their products from nothing.<br><br> As always, thanks so much for listening and I’ll see you next time.</p>
