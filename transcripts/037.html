                href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a>, where I find the
            founders behind profitable internet businesses and I try to get a sense of how they got started and what's
            going on behind the scenes, so that the rest of us can learn and build our own successful businesses.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Today, I'm talking to Jesse Patel. He's the founder of a really cool productivity app — one of my favorites
            — called <a href="https://www.workflowy.com">WorkFlowy</a>. I just logged into WorkFlowy today and it said
            that my account is 365 weeks old, which means that I joined in November of 2010, right after they launched.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's not often I get to say that I was one of the first users of a product, and even less often that I get
            to talk to one of the founders of that product, so I'm super excited to be talking to you, Jesse. Thanks for
            joining.</p>

            WorkFlowy. Just a few articles here and there. But from what I could find, it seems like it's intertwined
            with you teaching yourself how to code.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Maybe a good place to start is: How did you teach yourself to code, and why was that something you even
            wanted to do?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So, I think… I've kind of been teaching myself to code for a long time.
            I took some computer science classes, just like one-and-a-half, at Stanford when I was there, and it was
            like probably the thing I enjoyed the most but I just was… It was the first time I had done it, whereas
            everyone had been doing it since they were 12. And so I was like, "Okay, I'm not going to do this." From my
            first exposure, I liked the process of running into confusing things and having to fix them. Some people
            don't like that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            For me it was like, "This is just a fun puzzle and I really love to build things. I was trained as a product
            designer and building stuff is super fun. Coding let's you just build stuff yourself that other people can
            use in a really, really rewarding way. That was my motivation in general, so I'd been fiddling with it for
            years. Then at some point I had stuff I really wanted to build and I was like, "I'm just going to start
            building this." Actually, that was WorkFlowy. It was like a teaching-myself-to-code project. Everyone thinks
            they can make a better note-taking and task.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'll just waste that idea on learning to code because obviously it's not actually a good idea. Everyone
            thinks they can do it better, but why would I be any different so I'll use this delusion to learn how to
            program. Do you want me to talk a little bit about the motivation for the product itself or just the coding?

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it would be good to hear about the motivation for the product
            itself because like you said, everyone wants to build a to-do app. Everybody has their own unique styles of
            working and none of the existing tools match perfectly with what people want, and so there's tons of tools
            out there.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So what was motivating you? What did you not like about existing tools and what did you want WorkFlowy to do

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Basically I had this in 2000… It was a long time ago, 2008, I think. I
            was knee-deep in this job that was really complicated and I was basically the person in part in charge of
            the business development for a nonprofit tech company that was trying to decentralize video. It's kind of
            like an activist project and they were trying to figure out like how do we make money? Is there a way for us
            to make money in a business sense as opposed to raising money from donors which is what they had been doing?
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We had 4 million active users and so there was an audience, and we were trying to figure out, "What are the
            different ways we can monetize?" There were like 30 different legitimate things to explore, each of which
            would have a department at a real company or whatever. Everything from selling independent — it was a video
            thing — so selling independent films, to advertising, to customizing and selling the software itself to
            other people who distributed video. There were many different avenues to explore, and each of them was
            really complicated.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I was just cycling through product management to-do note-taking apps trying to keep track of all the
            complexity and getting really overwhelmed. I was going over everything, everything, everything and the thing
            I started using was Word outline mode.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I was like, "This is kind of the best, but I need it to be able to zoom in." This was like… I need to be
            able to in Basecamp or any of these other tools, they have a set structure and there always comes a point
            where you have a to-do that's like "make marketing proposal". Then you're like, okay, I want to write out
            the ideas for that marketing proposal, but I can't do it inside this to-do. It's *in* this to-do, it needs
            to be there. Basically, I just had this sense that I needed something fractal and that went in forever.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then having used the outline mode, I was like, "Oh, outlines are useful." This idea of combining what I knew
            was like this need for a fractal thing with an outline thing. The first version of WorkFlowy I built
            actually didn’t look like an outline at all. It was like more of a standard task list type thing that had…
            It looked like the McFinder with columns mode.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Basically since I started playing with it in 2000 before I even moved
            to Geneva, I started like I'm going to learn to code so I can build this thing. Probably it was 2008 that I
            started working on it a little bit. I mean it’s really slow when you're learning to code to make something.
            It was 2008 and in 2009, early 2009 I started doing a lot of work on it. It was June of 2009 that I started
            really working on it. I was in Berlin at the time working out of the SoundCloud offices.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Beginning of 2010 basically. It was like nine months after I really
            started working. I had something I really liked, I had a couple people who were using it and they really
            liked it. I was starting to go insane. I remember reading… I think it was like Naval had just launched
            Venture Hacks or something, or he hadn't just launched it, I had just discovered it rather. I had just
            discovered Venture Hacks. It was like end of 2009 and I was reading out voraciously all these articles and
            Hacker News and all this stuff.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It was like the dawn of the era of entrepreneurs writing honest things on the internet about starting
            business. Both Venture Hacks and just Paul Graham's stuff was like, "Find a co-founder. You're crazy if you
            don't find someone to work with."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Plus, I was having the sense of like, oh, I'm a very beginning programmer here. I'm running in circles a
            lot. I have no idea what I'm doing. I was like, I really need someone who's actually a good programmer to
            work with me and I'm just to go insane working on my own. So I just emailed two friends in probably December
            of 2009, and I was like, "Hey, I want to start something. Do you want to start something with me?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            One of them was like, "I just started something with another friend." These are two friends who I knew were
            technical and who were not working, and had just left their jobs. And the other one was Mike, and he was
            like, "This is a good time. I was just starting to think about what's next?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Mike I knew from college. We lived in the same dorm. We'd been friends for a number of years — we met
            probably in 2002. But we weren't super close friends. We were just friendly and in the same friend groups,
            so we'd see each other out and see each other at other people's houses, and we'd chat and catch up like,
            "What's been going on for the last few months or whatever?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then he just said, "It sounds good." We got on the phone and I talked to him about WorkFlowy and he said,
            "Not interested. Let's work on something else."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So we started working on and brainstorming other ideas, and we settled on a general area that was very
            different than WorkFlowy which was basically helping self-help gurus build ways for other people to follow
            their advice through an app. So basically, if you write a book saying, "Here's how you start your business
            or here's how you get a six pack in 100 days," we basically have the actions that you're recommending people
            do and a way for them to track whether they're doing it, and a way for you to engage with a community of
            followers, and all this encapsulating people's advice in an app.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            If you've published a book, the idea was that it would come with an app and a website that would help people
            actually do what you're suggesting they do.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That was the idea we were going to work on and we're starting to work

            idea and I just… He wasn't against it, but he was just like, "Whatever." I just applied for YC. I also
            decided at the time, I was living in Geneva, Switzerland because my now-wife, girlfriend at the time, was
            living there.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I decided if I was going to start something, I needed to move back to San Francisco and be near Mike if we
            were going to work together. Then once we got into YC, it was like, "Oh." Actually, I think I already had
            moved back at that point, so I guess YC didn't fit into the picture. I just knew I had to be back and I
            wasn't super happy in Geneva.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I mean I actually only had a couple users. It wasn't like I had a lot
            of validation at the time. And I think Mike's reasons were the same reasons that I thought it was like a
            throwaway project. I was rationalizing to myself that I didn't think it was a big deal because everyone
            thinks that they have the next big idea for how people organize themselves and how you could track your
            information and stuff. So it's like, I don't know?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And he's a guy who uses simple tools where he's like, "I'm happy with a text editor. I'm not trying to find
            the next new weird thing." I think that's basically why. He tried it. He was like, "I'm not that excited
            about this." And the area was also an area that he found very uninteresting.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Honestly, the rationale makes sense to me for why he didn't want to work on it, so I didn't exactly fight
            it. At the same time, I kept working on it and eventually it is what we ended up working on. I had
            conviction around it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The reason it wouldn't exist was because Mike and I entered Y Combinator with this idea and we were halfway
            through. I think almost immediately we realized that the original idea wasn't… We didn't want to work on it
            because it was too dependent on basically the publishers and the self-help gurus who were the people who
            were going to basically be writing the advice and publishing something in building an app with our thing.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We did a talk with Tim Ferriss and we talked to a couple of other people who just did, who were the kind of
            people we'd want to target and we realized that they just weren't going to care, they were going to be those
            kind of semi-invested people who you'd have to be fighting to get their attention and then all your
            promotion would depend on them and all your content would depend on them. You just would have no ability to
            independently… You basically wouldn't be in control of your own destiny is what I felt like. It's a
            two-sided marketplace where one party, not us, was in charge of both of my sides.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Again, this doesn't feel like a good idea. Then we were floundering around just experimenting with different
            things. We played with making a bunch of Facebook apps and we played with a couple of ideas but as soon as
            we decided that wasn't a good idea, I think I started lobbying Mike to start working on WorkFlowy because a
            couple people on YC had started using WorkFlowy and they really liked it and they were like, "Here's what
            needs to change about it. here's what's good and here's what's annoying." I was like, "This is further
            validation and we had nothing to work on right now." The other thing was Mike started using it and he was
            like, "Oh, I see how this is cool and how this is different." At this point, I had already rewritten it to
            look like a piece of paper until it worked like an outliner as opposed to the comms thing. Basically we
            switched half way through YC and actually didn't even tell. There's this thing at the time called Angel Day
            I think like Angel Demo Day. I don't think it happens anymore but we actually didn't tell anyone we were
            working on our WorkFlowy until we gave the presentation at Angel Day where we're presenting WorkFlowy.
            Everyone in YC was like, "We've never heard that before until you just presented it to everyone." We were
            like, "Sorry."</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think one of the cool things about WorkFlowy is it's like super
            innovative and super compelling because you invented something that was completely new. I mean there were
            other outliner tools but none of them really looked like WorkFlowy or worked like WorkFlowy and I think
            having that extra step of having to teach people how to use a product kills a lot of companies but it worked
            out for you.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I mean it took Mike a while but he eventually came around and decided that, "Hey, this is pretty cool."
            People in your batch also realized that it was pretty cool. I even remember reading a review from years and
            years ago about WorkFlowy were somebody called it, basically the best note-taking and organizer program that
            they had ever come across which is pretty high praise and I felt similarly when I first used it too so I'm
            just curious what makes WorkFlowy so good. Maybe you could describe it for people who never used it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Totally. Before I do that, I forgot the second part of the question for
            the YC thing because we're not people who promote things and I'm not a marketer so I would like to be but if
            WorkFlowy had never gone through YC, we would have three users. They would have kept using the product and
            they would have eventually maybe stop. Once we launched YC, it just gets you on TechCrunch and Lifehacker
            basically. Then on day one, we had 10,000 people using it and they didn't stop using it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            They were like, "Maybe this is real." before we had a couple of hundred people using it but it didn't feel
            like… It wasn't obvious to us that it was an opportunity but then once we had a much larger number of people
            using it which we would have never gotten, I never would have even emailed TechCrunch. I would have just
            been… It's a character flaw of mine. That was huge. Just that alone made an enormous difference. Anyways,
            pitching WorkFlowy is probably my greatest weakness.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            WorkFlowy is an application people use to organize all the information in their life, in their work and it
            becomes their hub. It's open on average for 11 hours a day which means people just have it open. It's like
            Gmail. People have been using it on average like our average active users have been using it for almost
            three years.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Two years. Which is a testament both to how useful it is to people but
            also to if we were growing super fast that would not be true. What it actually is, it's basically infinitely
            recursive bulleted list. A bulleted list where you can just dive down into any section and focus on that. It
            basically means you have a huge pile of information that is manageable at a human scale where you can slice
            it to see one part of it. You can also do tagging and searching so that you can just slice down your huge
            pile of information that hopefully has everything from all aspects of your life and then just see the one
            that you need to see and have it be kind of just easy to mess around it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think what's really special about it is it lets you create… That's one part of it is this lets you focus
            but the other thing is that it lets you create structure in a really low friction way. When you're using
            WorkFlowy, you just by default create some structure and you don't really have to think about it because
            it's bullet points but at the same time all other apps do for you like all the apps that are special CRMs or
            whatever, they're basically letting you create a structure. They define the structure for you like, "Your
            leads go in here and then when they're moved to this thing, we move them into this other… You click a button
            and you move into this other list."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Basically most software is list and moving stuff around lists and responding to when things move in to
            different lists of different categories in some sense. What we do is basically let people define software
            for themselves that works exactly how they want. It has a structure that's perfect for them and for their
            unique situation. I think that's what is really special about the product and also partially what makes it
            hard to really grok is that people have to say, "I have to figure out the right structure for myself." In
            addition to entering content, I have to be thinking about structure and thinking about how do I organize
            this? You don't have to and that's also… Structure just happens as well so that's cool.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think the first time I used WorkFlowy, I got it instantly after I
            created a few bullet points and zoomed into one and then it took over the entire document and that bullet
            point was down to top level. I was like, "Oh, okay. This is an indefinitely deep outline where I can put
            literally all of my information in this one document and it will never be too much because you can always
            zoom in and zoom out." Which is really cool because then you can organize things and reorganize them really
            easily unlike in Google Drive or something where if you mess up your folder hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You're never going to go back and fix it because it's too much work but if everything is in one document,
            you can easily copy and paste it so it's super cool and I understand why it really resonated with some
            people and fit into their working style in the way that other tools never did. Let's go back to your story
            at YC. You might not remember this because I barely remember it myself to be honest but I think we actually
            met briefly way back in 2011 at YC headquarters because you did, I think you were summer 2010, right? I was
            winter 2011 with another app called Taskforce. I think you and your co-founder, Mike may have come to my
            classes demo day. Do you remember coming to that or am I just making that up?</p>

            start a startup without raising but back then everybody wanted to raise money. I remember meeting you guys
            at YC because you guys were some of the few people who just didn't seem to care about it. I also met Kevin
            Hale from Wufoo who came to give a talk at one of our YC dinners and I was blown away by the things he
            talked about and how successful they were and how they also didn't care about doing the things like the
            conventional way. Also, the Basecamp guys stood out back then. I'm curious what was driving you and Mike to
            go alone and be independent and not really care about raising from investors?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think there are a couple of things. One was that I don't invest… We
            did talk to some… We spent a couple of weeks talking to investors after YC just because it's what everyone
            did and no one was interested because what we were doing was weird and hard to explain. It hadn't launched
            so we didn't have lots of users. I think if we had started raising like a day after we actually launched, we
            would had success. We did try is the answer like in the beginning just because okay I guess we should do
            this, everyone is doing it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We didn't really want to but we just felt pressured too. Then the further along we got, we were just like I
            don't like authority and I don’t like the idea of having bosses who aren't me. That's why I didn't want to
            raise money. Also it's all the stuff that people say about it reduces your outcomes, the scope of your
            outcomes a lot. If you raised money at whatever valuation, it means you're like the minimum at which if you
            sell it at that exact evaluation it's a failure.</p>

            your own. You're still living in San Francisco or the Bay Area, you're still paying probably ridiculously

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">This is one of our big areas of… One of the biggest issues between Mike
            and I in the early years was… He was like post-Google and he made tons of money at Google and he had all the
            stock. I was post working in a nonprofit and basically I spent all my money paying rent, then my girlfriend
            at the time basically just was paying rent of us, but we had enough users and they kept telling us they
            wanted to pay us.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            After a couple of years people started paying and it was pretty early on like we had significant revenue
            pretty quickly. People were willing to pay us so it was enough to pay rent and stuff. Basically like we just
            got really lucky and that we never did marketing and people would just write about the product because they
            loved it and we got a couple of really big people writing about it and then we’d have a lot more users and
            then people use it 11 hours a day so other people see it over their shoulders and then they're like, "What's
            that? That's weird. That's cool. I'm going to try it." Basically, we've just been very lucky and that the
            business has supported our and lazy approach.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">This is after I spent all my money, I was like, "Mike, we need to start
            charging." It wasn't on his radar and I was like, "Please," and he's like, "Okay, fine." It was just like…
            What we did was we… We were just wimpy people. What we did was we're going to grandfather every one… We're
            going to set usage quota which is 500 bullets a month you can add for free and then we're going to email
            everyone who was above that in the last few months and say, "Hey, we're going to launch a pro thing. You can
            have it for free but please pay us anyways."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            In the first day, almost 30% of the people we sent that email to signed up for pro. We were basically
            immediately making a decent amount of money. It was just clear that people wanted to pay us. They wanted to
            support us. They wanted the product to get better and to survive. It was stressful and for me it was…
            Honestly, for Mike, I don't think it was stressful not making money from the product. For me it was
            stressful because I spent all my money. Then once that happened, I think it was clear that this was the real
            thing.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Honestly, it was just like whenever I brought up the conversation, it
            was just not… It didn't feel like it was a priority for… I mean first of all, there was a period where we
            didn't have enough users. It would have made a huge… It would have been a lot of money so basically once we
            got to the point where it's like, "Now, we have a lot of users and we can probably… " If we think about how
            much we can make it probably would be meaningful.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then it became the question of like, "For Mike, it wasn't a priority. He was just thinking all that matters
            is getting a lot of users and they're willing to pay us to make money. Then for me it was a priority because
            I didn't have any money. It was just a matter of talking about it together enough that he understood where I
            was coming from like… We had this conversation. It was like, "I didn't realize you spent all your money." I
            had no idea. Having those conversations which is actually… I don't know if you want me to throw in advice
            but one of the biggest things I would suggest people do if you're starting a new thing with any other humans
            is have a weekly structured conversation where you bring up any issues that haven't been resolved because
            issues that fester like something small can become something big.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Any accumulation of loss of small things becomes a terrible relationship so basically have a weekly
            conversation where you go like, "Is there anything that's bother you? Is there anything that hadn't been
            addressed?" and just deal with it and if it turns into a big, get some third-party to help you figure it out
            where it's some person you will trust or a paid coach or whatever it is because that's how we didn't end up
            charging people… That's how I end up spending all my money with it because he didn't even realize that I was
            spending all my money. You know what I mean?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I mean there was communication. It was like if you're really focused on

            you like you try to slip it in and it's not even heard because everyone is distracted and everyone… If we're
            communicating constantly about the product and about lots of things but there's this one thing that I'm
            like, "A little ashamed about it because I didn't have that much money to begin with."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            My sense is that relationship issues are one of the biggest things and that biggest issues with companies
            and I mean I know that from talking from tons and tons of people is just that co-founder relationships are
            really difficult and I would just say like marriages like the ones that work are the ones who you address
            the issues, small issues before they become big issues. How to process where every week, you're just like,
            "Is anything wrong? Let's deal with it."</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Which is I think a really smart idea because the problems are the same
            I mean you have this thing, you have this relationship that's just as close or almost as close as the
            relationship between a married couple or parents or something where you've got this startup that you're
            working on and it's your baby. It's the thing that matters to you most in life except like everything else
            in your life, this other person has a say and what goes on.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I totally agree with you that people don't talk enough about co-founder relationship issues but every
            startup that I've started with somebody else there have been low screaming fights at least once and now I'm
            now working with my brother where we've been doing that since we were kids so it's no big deal. It's super
            easy to recover but anyway on Mixergy interview, we got to hear Mike's side of things where he talked about
            the differences between you and how you really focused on moving fast and you were a little bit more risky
            and he was a lot more risk averse.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think it would be interesting to hear your side of that conflict as well. What separates the two of you?
            What was hard for you about working with Mike and how did you guys resolve things?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">A lot of the things that were difficult are similar things that are
            difficult with my wife to be honest. It's funny for me to see it's not just them. One is that I am
            impulsive. I would say I'm impulsive and Mike is the opposite of impulsive. It's extremely deliberate. I'm
            probably not deliberate enough. Mike is too deliberate, I'm not deliberate enough. I just want to think of
            things and do them and try them and Mike wants to think about them probably longer than he needs to which
            we've both talked about this. We both agree that that's overall probably true for both of us.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's part of it. That's a bigger picture strategy thing but I think almost as big a part of it is just
            like working styles. I always just wanted to talk about what I was thinking about and then this is the same
            issue that I have with my wife is that which I'm sure she'll really appreciate me talking a lot on which is
            that I have an idea and I just want to talk it through whereas being a deliberate person you think like this
            person is talking about something. That means they want to do it or it means I have to really think harder
            about this whereas I'm just going to talk about 30 things a day which I don't even think are good ideas. I
            just want to think it through. Just throwing stuff out there.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, exactly. I think that was a big part of it. There was also just
            working style. It's like I really want to work together in a sense of I like pair programming is a good
            example. I love looking at the same screen as people and doing things together and he doesn't. He just likes
            to be in his own world and think really hard about things. He's brilliant. He makes great decisions and so
            it's like I can't for that but he doesn't like to be working in real-time together basically.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            He likes to talk about things ahead of time and then go apart, and do the things you talked about
            individually. It's just like working style things both being interrupted all the time and that difference
            around how you wanted to work day to day. It just led to us feeling… I think both of us feeling very
            neglected and leading to conflict because it's just like our needs weren't being met. I would bring up stuff
            over and over again in the way.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I would just be pushing at him a little bit because I just wanted that interaction. I'm extremely
            extroverted person. I just wanted interaction and he would be frustrated because I could be taking amount of
            his flow slash giving him ideas that he's not even sure if he has to really think about it or not. I mean
            does that make sense?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. It makes perfect sense. I mean you're describing anyone who has
            any close relationship with somebody has some ways in which they're different and they're going to wrap up
            against each other and they're not going to be able to talk about… They might neglect to talk about exactly
            how they're feeling underneath. It's so easy to misinterpret what the other person is doing and sometimes
            just listening to how the other person feels without getting defensive or fighting back is going to help to
            make them feel a whole lot better.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's super hard to do that especially when you're implicated in making
            them feel bad. It's just really hard to hear I've done something that makes someone else feel bad. I think
            these are really like… Those are the dynamics and then the fact that we never really dealt with them was the
            problem. I think all those dynamics were fine and then they just built up to this point where we went on
            this walk. I remember the walk really vividly. We were working out of my friend's company and we walked to
            Dolores Park. We sat on this bench.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I just remember Mike saying like, "I don't think I can do this anymore." Both of us being miserable. I was
            not thinking about stopping but Mike was just like, "Look, dude. This is really unpleasant. We're just
            fighting. Every time we talked, we're fighting basically." I was like, "This is really broken." Then we went
            to therapy and it was helpful. We stopped therapy way too early because I was feeling very heavy pinching
            and it's not cheap. We should have just never stopped going to therapy.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don't want to spend the entire episode talking about co-founder
            issues but I think it's really good to bring it up because like you said earlier there's a tremendous amount
            of advice out there that says you need to find a co-founder and that'll be more likely to succeed as a
            co-founder but it's important to look at the other side of the equation as well which is that a tremendous
            percentage of companies fail because of co-founders issues and co-founders not getting along so it's a
            double-edge sword and I know personally I've been in a situation a couple of times where businesses I might
            have otherwise done well failed because of my relationship with co-founders.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            One of the cooler things that I think you brought up earlier as well is the metrics behind WorkFlowy, how
            long people use the app like 11 hours a day how long they stay an average of three years. Were things like
            that right out of the gate right when you guys launched on TechCrunch and Lifehacker early on, did you guys
            have a really high retention rate or did it take a lot of work to get to the point where people loved the
            product and were loyal to you?</p>

            never stop using it. It's been like that from the beginning and that basic dynamic is what… The number has
            gone up as we've entered the product. The numbers have all gotten better. The basic dynamic has been there.
            That's why we were like, "This is the real opportunity," because on day one, we had 10,000 people using it
            and then they were telling other people about it and as people dropped off we were replacing them with new
            people just through word of mouth and it grew… It was just growing on its own. It's been a really high

            tools in the past to you and retention is so hard with productivity because you're essentially building a
            tool to help people do work, do things that are effortful. If you're browsing Facebook, it's fun. You're
            addicted to it but if you're putting tasks into Asana or you're making an outline in WorkFlowy about things
            you have to get done or other forms of work then that stuff that people might just fail to do all on their
            own even if people have a great product because they lack the motivation and that's effortful.</p>

            feel like WorkFlowy is this huge… Both something that I really love and want to have a vision for. I want to
            make it realize that vision and also just a huge opportunity that's mostly unrealized because it has
            relatively small… It's like reaching just a drop of potential people it could reach.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Just everything is so much smaller than I think it really could be. About a year ago, I had that realization
            and started talking to Mike about it and so basically over this current year I have basically been… We just
            started building team and hiring people and doing stuff. Now, I have three… It's me and I have two other
            full-time employees who aren't Mike and several contractors who are doing a lot of work and we're just… It's
            like we're ramping up and starting a startup.</p>

            wherever you want to. You got a lot of diehard fans. I mean you're not Tom Cruise but people like WorkFlowy
            and you guys have a following. I'm curious what is driving you? What do you want WorkFlowy to be? It sounds

            ways like 30% of what it could be. I just want it to be what it could be. Then there's this full other angle
            which is there's this thing… That's a huge part of it. I just want this thing to be what it can be and
            realize its potential. I know there's all this people who love it for whom it changes their lives and I want
            that group to be a lot bigger. I know there's just a lot of people for whom it could be a very important

            ways but also the fact that you've never done any marketing or outreach or anything is also silly and that
            we need to do that but my personal motivation like the area I'm focused on is how do we make the product
            stickier for any users so that they have a higher percentage of the average new person who comes to
            WorkFlowy. We have 20,000 new sign ups a month from word of mouth and then… Think about it. Only a few like
            maybe a thousand of those people actually become real users like long-term users who use it for many, many
            months or whatever.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">For long-term retention, I'm not sure but I just know that products
            that do really well, do a lot better and I know that most people who sign up… Not most people but half the
            people who sign up don't even create a single bullet on the first day so I just that we're failing in a
            pretty profound way. Basically, that's part of just making the current product more obvious how to use it.
            There's lots of obvious things that need to be done, lots of features people been asking for years like
            mobile being better and mobile having all the features of desktop, mobile being actually designed for mobile
            is a huge thing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Improving how collaboration works so that you can actually have a team that really stays safe to keeping all
            their information at WorkFlowy is a huge… That's probably the biggest strategic thing. There's basically
            like make their product better so dates and reminders, mobile, all that stuff. All the stuff that everyone
            wants and all our users want and they've been telling us they want for ages just like getting product and
            making the product better is a huge part of what I want to work on or what I think will make it stickier as
            well as having new user experiences that are customized for all the different ways to please WorkFlowy and
            letting our users create those experiences for other people.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then the collaboration thing is just massive. That's the biggest strategically important thing. It depends
            on the product being great but making the product so that when I open WorkFlowy, if you have wanted my
            attention on something it will draw my attention to that. If you have something nested like 30 levels down,
            and you're saying I want Jesse's feedback and you should be able to tag me and then the product will show it
            to me. Likewise, if I want to just keep track on some projects they care about that everyone is managing in
            WorkFlowy, I should be able to do just open the app and see it or get notifications or whatever.</p>

            this gigantic to-do list and I've talked about this before that never get smaller. No matter how many things
            I cross off that list and the amount of time I've added more things that I want to do and I'm sure the same
            is true with you. How do you prioritize? How do you know what goes to the top of the list and how do you
            figure out what which of your team members are going to work on which things?</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Basically, there's a couple parts of it. One is reactive so what do
            people… This is a prioritization about who's going to work on what but part of it is just like, "We get a
            lot of feedback from people and we have a lot of really passionate users. They tell us what they care about.
            Mobile being better is really obvious. One of the things that's wonderful about working on a consumer
            product that is actually useful is that you end having a lot of friends who use it so you get a lot of
            anecdotal feedback and you can see whether that mashes up with feedback you're getting through your official
            channels but basically we get a lot of feedback and it's like this is obviously the stuff people care about
            and the stuff people want.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's one side of it and there's also the vision part of things which is I have a vision for WorkFlowy and
            I have an aesthetic and I have all these things I want because I want them and because that's how I've
            always imagined that I want WorkFlowy to be this shared… A lot of people… Probably a lot of our users don't
            care about collaboration in WorkFlowy. They probably… A lot of them do it. I know that for a fact but I'm
            sure a lot of them are like, "This is my private tool. I don't want to share it with anyone."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            For me the fact is like I've always imagined it being the way you can have your brain and also share parts
            of your brain with other people. Part of it is just like vision and inspiration. It's like being an artist,
            here's this thing. Here's how I want it to work. Those mesh in terms of prioritization so if there are
            things when I overlap, I'm like, "I've always wanted this." I just think it's cool or whatever it is and
            people are asking for it then that's very… Sometimes it's like confirmation bias where I'm listening to the
            feedback that people want, that I want to hear from people.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's like those two things play against each other because I care a lot about what people think and what our
            users want so one of my big things like if I was to give advice to someone, a new person is watch people
            like literally watch people use your product. Either physically or either video chat like just watch people
            use it. You just get so many insights from doing that and it gives you a very human view on your product and
            all the ways in which either it sucks or is great or both of those.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I just talked to David Darmanin, COO of Hotjar. I don't know if you've

            want to watch 2,000 people use my… Sign in and it'll take a bunch of recordings and you can watch it. It's
            not quite as good as sitting down with somebody in real life where you can ask them about what they did

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think another thing that we haven't talked very much about is
            marketing because WorkFlowy has grown so far, it that's entirely word of mouth which is amazing. One of the
            things that I tell a lot of people who are just starting out is if they should consider picking a niche and
            that way they can build something really valuable for a specific group of people and that group is more
            likely to fall in love with the product because it's built just for them and whereas the competitors tools
            aren't built more generally but for WorkFlowy, I feel like your product completely flies in the face of that
            principal.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's not built for teachers or programmers or sales people. It's just a general product for everyone. I'm
            curious who are these hardcore WorkFlowy users. Is there a pattern that you've discerned among them? Are you
            guys trying to discern that or is it right now just it could be anybody.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it's a very interesting… It's a very interesting question and I
            think… To some degree we have built a niche product except it's not niche for a segment, for a specific
            purpose, it's niche for people who like to work in a specific way and people who are smart enough to figure
            out how to use a general tool. They're not smart enough. I think it's very smart to market to specific used
            cases. WorkFlowy is used by everyone from piano teachers to CEOs of public companies so it's a genuine… I'm
            not surprised if someone says, "My mom just recommended WorkFlowy to me." That happens a lot. I think it
            does skew techie a little bit but it's still a very broad product that does appeal to very wide array of
            people who would be hard to… If you saw them together in a room, you'd be like, "What conference is this?
            I'm very confused." I think that our… One of the biggest areas that I want to focus on in the future is
            making it so that you can essentially. If you are a piano teacher or you are a COO of a big company who
            needs to manage all of their one-on-one's or you are a customer… A client-facing… A business that has
            clients that needs to move through your pipeline that you can come to WorkFlowy and come to essentially a
            structure and something that feels like an app that is customized for you because I do think both for
            marketing and for onboarding, it is super important to show people how to use the product for their own
            purposes and in a way that fits into their own life.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I went to a conference last year, the biggest investigative journalism conference. I'd give a presentation
            along with some of the other people on tools and then I had a breakout session where 20 people came the idea
            was like how to create your hyper personalized organizational system in WorkFlowy. Of those 20 people, all
            journalist, one person looked at WorkFlowy and checked out the site and tried the demo and had their eyes go
            wide and say, "Oh, wow. I get this. I see how I can use this for everything. I can how I can use this for
            this part of my work and this part of my work and this part of my… "</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Everyone else really needed to be shown how to use it for journalism and needed specific… They all the same
            needs and they all really needed to be shown. Right now, we don't do that and I think because of that we are
            missing out in a massive way. I was talking to one guy who's an investor, who was like I used WorkFlowy as
            an example. This is very none self-promotional here. An example of one of the biggest failures that I know
            of whether they've just left so much on the table because they haven't done… They have this product which
            has this kernel of something amazing but they haven't done anything with it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            They haven't promoted it and they haven't built it out to its potential. I tell that because I agree with it
            and that's why I'm doing all this stuff now and that's why I'm building the team. I was just saying like I
            think that that advice is good advice that you give people. I don't know. For me, I'm just… My
            entrepreneurial story is doing lots of things that I think are bad ideas and not working out.</p>

            people that's okay because there's lot of other people out there who think like you do. Apparently 5% of
            people and you could figure out how to make it appeal to other people and other specific niches later on.

            Listening to you talk about the challenges that are happening, I feel super excited for WorkFlowy because
            there's so much low hanging fruit. It's not like you guys had spent 10 years trying every single thing and
            nothing has worked but you guys have done very little in some areas. Marketing and still things are looking
            very promising.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The thought on the clones is basically like we didn't do much for a
            long time and that is why clones exists because there's a lot of stuff that the product needs and I think
            some of the clones are nice but none of them get the details I think as right as we do. Most of them are
            focused on adding more features. The biggest thing that I see with clones is that they don't have… I would
            say they're not me. They don't have the vision that I have. I see them, I'm like, "Oh, here's a nice one
            that did a nice job. That's interesting."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then I look into it, I'm like, "Oh, okay. Once we start having product momentum, we're going in a different
            direction. They're adding the obvious adjacent things that are needed which we will do but they're not
            building into the future where WorkFlowy is a tool that actually makes you smarter and this is a tool that
            helps you think through things in ways that you don't know how to think through and all these things that
            just come out of who I am kind of I think. A lot of them are none obvious but I think there's a lot of
            obvious stuff that could be added to WorkFlowy which is good and I'm glad that people are doing it but
            they're also… When I look at them there's two things. One, I'm like, "That's not as polished as it needs to
            be and it doesn't work quite as well as it needs to." Just the direction of the product is not as inspiring.
            I don't see this product working out and being used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>

            mad scientist creations when you do. Thanks a ton for coming on the podcast. Can you let people know where
            they can go to find out more about what you're up to at WorkFlowy and about you personally?</p>
