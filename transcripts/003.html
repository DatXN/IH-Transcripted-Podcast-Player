        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">In 2003, David Hauser and his co-founder Siamak
            started
            Grasshopper, and thus began their journey in bootstrapping a business that would go
            on
            to
            generate $30
            million a year in revenue. I'm Courtland Allen, and I've interviewed a lot of
            founders
            for <a href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a>,
            but
            none
            who've achieved that level of success, especially without raising any money
            whatsoever
            from
            venture
            capitalists. In this converation with David, I really wanted to pick his brain about
            the
            kinds
            of things
            that early stage founders and aspiring entrepreneurs could do to raise their chances
            of
            building
            a
            hugely successful business like he did. We talked about everything from coming up
            with a
            solid
            initial
            business idea and how to find your customers in places nobody else is looking to
            managing your
            work-life
            balance, or as he calls it, your work-life integration. David has a ton of
            insightful
            knowledge
            to
            share, and I know you guys are going to enjoy this interview and learn a lot, so I
            present to
            you David
            Hauser, the founder of Grasshopper. Before we get started, let me tell you about a
            group
            of guys
            that I
            got to know a couple of months ago. They reached out to me as fellow MIT alums, and
            I
            ended up
            interviewing them about one of their profitable side projects on <a href="http://indiehackers.com"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a>. Dixon
            &amp; Moe is a boutique digital
            agency. They're technical designers with a focus on business and marketing and they
            specialize
            in
            helping bootstrapped founders grow their products. They're based in San Francisco,
            and
            they work
            with
            founders from all over the world. And they're big advocates of the indie hacker
            movement, both
            as
            participants, having made several revenue-generating projects in-house, and as
            design
            and
            development
            consultants who work with an array of founders and products. For example, they
            helped
            the
            founder of
            WisePops grow his revenue from 10 to $50,000 a month and quit his job at Amazon to
            go
            full-time
            on his
            side project. They helped Alex from GrooveHQ, who by the way has David Hauser as his
            lone
            investor, to
            reposition his help desk software from a scrappy app for startups to a professional
            tool
            used by
            companies big and small. He's now making $500,000 a month. Dixon &amp; Moe are
            looking
            to take
            on two
            new projects this year and would love to see where they can help. You can chat with
            them
            over
            email or
            phone about any design, development or marketing problem that you're struggling
            with.
            Reach out

            Courtland from Indie Hackers
            sent you. Hi, everybody, this is Courtland from Indie Hackers and I'm sitting down
            today

            Hauser, the founder of Grasshopper and Chargify. How you doing, Dave?</p>

            in your career, including Grasshopper and Chargify, and I am personally the most

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Sure, yeah, so myself and my business partner,
            Siamak,
            started
            Grasshopper more than 12 years ago now. And the simplest way to describe it is we
            provide a
            virtual
            phone system for entrepreneurs. So what does that mean? It means, you know, the
            phone
            system
            you'd
            expect in a big office, press one for sales, two for support, on-hold music,
            transferring, you
            know, all
            those features just totally virtual, so no hardware, no software to install, all web
            based, but
            you can
            also still keep using the cell phone that you have or if you do have a VoIP line or
            anything
            else, so
            it's pretty flexible. And we designed for that, because we knew that entrepreneurs
            really have
            lots of
            varying degrees of offices and setups and even moreso now, remote employees and
            things
            like
            that. So I
            mean, that's kind of what we did, and we served over 250,000 customers over that
            period
            of time,
            and,
            you know, learned a lot along the way.</p>

            and just under 40 full-time employees, mostly in our office in Massachusetts, just
            outside of
            Boston.
            So, pretty sizable company, a solid management team that was really running a lot of
            the
            business, you
            know, a lot of those things, it made a good acquisition for Citrix.</p>

            about the
            founding
            of Grasshopper. I think a lot of listeners are at that beginning stage, where
            they're
            thinking
            about
            starting a business, but they're maybe not quite sure how to come up with a good
            idea or
            what it
            is they
            should be working on. So I'm curious how did you at Grasshopper decide to build a
            virtual phone
            system.
            Where did the idea come from? And what motivated you to get started?</p>

            calling,
            you know,
            our cell phone, and we'd just pick up at random times. We needed a professional
            image.
            And we
            went out
            there and looked for this, and there weren't really many options, right. The options
            that were
            available
            were either very expensive or not flexible and the technology itself was actually
            quite
            easy,
            right.
            This wasn't a magical technology that we created. It'd been around for a long time.
            But
            we knew
            the
            problem was. It wasn't packaged correctly for what we, at the time, called small
            business users.
            And we
            kind of, over time, learned that the better term, that people identified with was
            entrepreneurs.
            But it
            just wasn't packaged and priced for them. So we spent the time to create the
            solution
            and
            package and
            price it for the right market.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty in the
            beginning
            for
            most
            people, and it sounds like what you're saying is that nobody was doing what you were
            doing in
            the way
            that you wanted to do it, which was to sell to small business users and
            entrepreneurs.
            But there
            was
            really no guarantee at that point that it was gonna work out, right, because maybe
            you
            could've
            tried
            doing it, and there would be enough people who wanted a professional virtual phone
            system or
            some other
            problem. So what did it take to validate your idea early on? Was there some aha
            moment,
            where
            you
            realized hell yeah, this is gonna work out. Or were you confident from the very
            beginning?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I think we were kind of young and stupid in
            that
            we were
            confident from the very beginning, but I think it came from the fact we were solving
            a
            problem
            we had,
            right. It wasn't something that we heard from other people necessarily or kind of
            magically
            created.
            This was a problem we had, right, directly. And I think some of the best products
            are
            really
            created
            this way, because you could can somewhat skip a little bit of the step of talking to
            users right
            away,
            because you at least know the base of what you're talking about, right. And that's
            not
            to
            negate, like,
            it is super important to get real-user feedback, but we knew we were solving a
            problem.
            And I
            think we
            ignored a lot of the other things. And then we got to selling right away. Like,
            rather
            than talk
            about
            it and see and kind of pontificate about why it should work or wouldn't, we're like
            okay, let's
            just
            sell this to people. And we started selling way earlier than we should've, but I
            think
            it's the
            best
            thing we ever did.</p>

            And
            customers
            would call you, and while you were on the phone, you would be writing SQL queries to
            look up the

            an interface to do it or a CMS or a support ticketing, like, people would call. We'd

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Interesting. So I talked to a lot of people who
            are
            starting
            businesses, especially developers, and what you guys did is almost the exact
            opposite of
            what
            most
            developer founders do. The temptation for programmers oftentimes is to just build,
            build, build,
            before
            talking to anybody, and often they spend weeks or even months just building out
            their
            software
            without
            talking to a single person about it. Well, you guys are the opposite. Your whole
            viewpoint was
            that the
            system was crucial, but you could build it out later and just wing it for now. And
            for
            now,
            selling is
            the number one priority. So why were you guys so focused on selling when it's not
            the
            intuitive
            way to
            go for a lot of people?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, I mean, I think there's two factors. One,
            we
            didn't
            have very
            much capital, so we had to bootstrap the business. We just had a little bit of money
            from past
            ventures
            and such, and it wasn't a tremendous amount. And this was way before, you know, kind
            of
            the true
            cloud
            computing. There was no Twilio for telecom. We were having to buy physical equipment
            and
            run T1
            lines
            and do these things. So the cost of doing so was just very fixed, right. And we knew
            that we
            weren't
            going to get very far if we spent a lot of time doing that and not selling. And then
            both of us,
            although I'm technical, right, I can write code, and I have written code. I'm not
            great
            at it.
            You know,
            now, today, I can probably review it better than I can write it. Both of us kind of
            came
            from
            more
            business backgrounds. So all we really knew was, like, let's market and sell this.
            Like,
            that's
            what we
            knew. We both went to Babson College, and that's the background we had.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it's a background that a lot of
            programmers
            don't
            have,
            including myself, because I basically had to spend the last 10 years in the school
            of
            hard
            knocks, just
            trying to figure out how to do some of this stuff. But it's really interesting to
            look
            back at
            the time
            period where you were creating Grasshopper and to look at the differences, because
            there
            was no
            cloud
            computing. There was no Twilio or AWS. And so in a way a lot of the things that you
            could do
            were very
            limited. You just didn't have that many tools to build on top of, which seems like a
            disadvantage, at
            first glance, but it's also advantageous, in a way, because it forced you guys to
            get in
            a
            mindset of
            selling immediately.</p>

            and stacking them in a data center, and you know, like, what people wouldn't even
            imagine you
            would do
            today, right. And I think, two things we did, right. We used the capital that we had
            as
            efficiently as
            possible. So we negotiated terms with every vendor we worked with, some vendors
            extending us
            terms that
            they probably shouldn't have, right, because they believed in what we were doing,
            right.
            We sold
            them on
            the vision of, like, we're building something for entrepreneurs, and that's who we
            are.
            We
            believe this
            is gonna work, and here's why. And they probably gave us terms that they hadn't
            given
            others,
            and they
            shouldn't have given us, right. So we took probably about 200, $250,000 and ended
            up,
            you know,
            putting
            together an infrastructure that should've cost us probably about $1 million. From
            servers,
            Oracle
            database(s), like, those are things that are quite expensive and then also bringing
            in
            physical
            T1 and
            then as we got bigger, DS3 lines and stuff to these data centers. Like those are
            hard
            costs that
            today,
            people don't even think about.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it was a hard time. You know, we sold
            them on
            our
            vision. We
            sold them on who we were. And I think it really came down to people believing that
            what
            we were
            telling
            them actually was a need. So that was some validation even before we were able to
            sell,
            that
            other
            people saw this as a need, especially as we talked to people in telecom, right,
            because
            had to
            negotiate
            contracts to buy phone numbers and minutes and things like that, right. And we got
            feedback
            like, you
            know, we're gonna start referring people to you right away, because we get customers
            that are
            too small,
            that always want this, right. So I think that was good. And we stuck with those same
            vendors for
            a long
            time and probably longer than we should've from a cost perspective. We were loyal to
            them,
            because they
            helped us start. And over time, obviously, we did start to migrate to larger tier
            one
            vendors
            compared
            to tier two vendors and things like that, but look, I think they made a good
            investment,
            and it
            paid off
            for them.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Until you eventually grew to the huge numbers,

            you
            were
            saying, 250,000 customers served and making $30 million a year. One constant that
            I've
            seen in
            talking
            to different founders and entrepreneurs is that there's always a difference between
            what
            founders
            believe and what the actual reality of the world is. For example, you, as a founder,
            might have
            ideas
            about who your customers are or what they want or the best place to reach them or
            what
            messages
            they'll
            respond to, and you might not be accurate in all those assumptions. I assume that
            you
            guys
            weren't
            perfect in the beginning, but you grew so much in the end that you had to have
            eventually
            successfully
            aligned your beliefs and hypothesis with the reality of the world. So what are some
            of
            the
            things that
            you learned, and also what methods did you find the best for learning what product
            to
            build and
            how to
            reach customers?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I think that's a great question. And
            quite
            honestly,
            I think
            we got all of it wrong at the beginning, and maybe towards the end, we got a little
            bit
            right.
            But I
            think it's an ongoing battle in both directions, right, in that, you know, when
            you're
            starting,
            you
            have this vision that no matter what, you're gonna persevere through everything,
            right.
            And it's
            like
            all green in front of you, right. In kind of the middle, you worry a little bit
            more,
            and you're
            like
            okay, now there's some reality setting in. Like, it's a little bit harder to sell
            than I
            thought. It
            costs more to market, right. And I think that kind of continues. And if you lose
            that,
            that's
            when you
            start losing, and competition comes in and kills you, right. And I think one of the
            things we
            learned
            towards the middle as well which was we thought we had kind of capped out on the
            market.
            We're
            like, you
            know, others around us are like, "Look, the market's only so big." We're worried
            that
            we're
            starting to
            kind of plateau in growth. We had many plateaus in growth, and then we had growth
            spurts, right.
            And we
            kind of started to believe this ourselves. So we spent time focusing on other
            products,
            and we
            built
            other things. And that's when we built Chargify, and a bunch of other stuff that
            failed.
            Chargify
            actually did well. And we lost focus on the business, and looking back on it, what
            we
            really
            realized is
            we were wrong. We got bored, and we should've stayed focused. And we, you know,
            there
            was plenty
            of
            growth in front of us. We just weren't looking in the right places.</p>

            way
            better than what they were working on at first. Or people, like for example, the

            positive
            and
            wait too
            long, right. But that's what creates success, where I think, those that fail didn't
            have
            that
            same
            drive, or, you know, if you just hire a manager to run a business, right, they're
            much
            more
            pragmatic
            about it, right. Founders have that vision, like, "I don't really care what else is

            going in a
            different direction than you should be. So are there any examples, and I'm
            especially
            interested
            in the
            early days, but are there any examples where there's something that you learned from

            of a popular thing to even, you know, in the tech community, say you talk to
            customers,
            right.
            So we
            didn't understand that at all. So we built and packaged the product in a very
            complex
            way that
            we
            understood, right. And this came out in user churn, right, which was we were
            onboarding
            customers that
            were not as technology savvy as we were, right, and either would call up, and it
            would
            cost us a
            lot of
            money in support time and cost, because we always provided 24/7, US based support,
            not
            outsourced to
            another country, right, and true 24/7, not like open a ticket and wait. Like, call
            us
            and we
            answer the
            phone, right. So we saw it in churn and cost. And that's when we realized uh oh,
            like,
            we have a
            problem
            here that yes, we've built something that people want, because we've shown that we
            can
            get
            people to
            sign up, effectively, at good CPAs, but now, we're having people churn out, and
            we're
            having
            onboarding
            problems, right. And that's when we started to say okay,</p>

            we

            years too,
            where,
            you know, I think, as you grow, and you have 10 people and then 20 and then 30 and
            50 or
            whatever,
            right, you lose touch with the customer. and especially, you know, developers,

            they kind
            of get
            insulated from support, right, because it's, quote-unquote, a distraction. So we had
            a
            program
            where
            everyone had to make seven phone calls to new customers, everyone, no matter what
            position you
            were,
            right. And it was just a welcome, but like, very quickly, a welcome turned into hey,
            I
            love
            this, I hate
            this. Why is there a problem with this? Right, like, it was instant feedback and
            just
            seven
            phone calls.
            It only took a little bit of time, but it kind of brought back that touch.</p>

            in my

            to
            all-online,

            on
            the
            phone. You
            get much more instant and direct feedback. You can ask questions right away. And you
            can
            make a
            real
            connection with a customer. And what we found was it costs us a lot of money, like,
            no
            question,
            right.
            However, for sure, this contributed to our extremely high word-of-mouth referrals,
            which
            we
            maintained
            at between kind of 22 and 30% until we sold the company, right. Which as you're

            marketing is
            very hard to do.</p>

            from
            search paid traffic with Omniture, which was the precursor to AdWords. So we did
            that.
            We did
            some print
            stuff, which sounds crazy, but there's a clear target for SMBs. At the time there
            was
            Entrepreneur

            those
            were the
            initial channels. The other one, we spent a lot of time on was organic SEO. It was
            very
            clear
            that there
            was a need for people searching for these terms. And those people were converting at
            much higher
            rates,
            because it was intent purchases, right. So all of our initial targeting, like from
            day
            one to
            the first
            12 months, was like someone is looking for small business phone system, virtual PBX,
            professional phone,
            those types of terms, and we just converted them as best we could.</p>

            I'm
            looking at,
            like, how am I buying traffic on Instagram and Pinterest and places like that, where
            there is
            still
            intent. It's not as direct as search, right, but there's still intent, and I can buy
            traffic
            very cheap,
            because there are newer platforms that are still trying to prove themselves, right.

            where
            we're gonna go from, you know, 25,000 customers to a million customers, guys. Like,
            don't worry,
            we're
            gonna find this channel. Right? And I think just it doesn't exist, right. And people
            always hear
            about
            these stories where the companies we know, quote-unquote, or that are success
            stories,
            yes, they
            have
            millions of customers, but there was no magic channel that got them there, but
            that's
            what the
            story
            usually is, right. So we tested everything, right, and we failed at most of it, but
            along the
            way, we
            found things that worked for us, right. So along the way, we found that satellite
            radio
            worked
            for us.
            We were the first advertiser with XM, well, at the time, Sirius, right, when Howard
            Stern moved
            over,
            right. So we signed up very early, and we scaled that channel to well over 50 or
            $100,000 a
            month. Then
            we had lots of failures. We tried tray table ads on planes. We tried--</p>

            happened
            was, you
            know, these little tests became bigger and bigger, right. So when we were small, a
            test
            might've
            been
            $100 or $1,000, right. When we were growing, a test might've been $1,000 or $10,000.
            As
            we kind
            of
            matured a little bit, and we got bigger, and we were starting to get closer to 30
            million in
            revenue,
            tests became, you know, a few hundred thousand dollars. Or in our, you know, the
            year
            before we
            sold, we
            had a million-dollar test in radio, right. So we decided that terrestrial radio was
            the
            right
            approach.
            We had all the right metrics, but the cheapest you can really test terrestrial radio
            in
            three
            demographics and do it the right way is about $1 million. So that was a test, right.
            We
            were
            pretty
            confident in it, to put that type of money up, but it was still a test. It worked
            and we
            scaled
            that
            channel to $12 million, you know, very quickly.</p>

            quite a
            number
            of years ago, now, is we really learned that testing was critical, and this was
            early on
            in A/B
            testing
            tools, and we had a few people come in and really help us and build a culture of
            testing. And
            this
            culture of testing started to really go throughout the organization, not just in
            marketing, not
            just in
            conversion, but A/B testing onboarding tools. Literally, the question was have you
            tested this,
            right,
            internally? And yeah, I think it helped us tremendously, and we tested pricing
            plans,
            pricing
            increases.
            We did different tests on how we increased plans on our user base or not on it.
            Everything was
            tested.

            doing are
            working.
            And speaking of blindly assuming, I want to talk about how people will look at an
            established
            business,
            like Grasshopper, in maybe its 10th or 11th year, and they see what it looks like,
            and
            they see
            that
            things that it's doing, and then they assume that it's always been this way. And so
            they
            try to
            copy it.
            And they don't realize that the assumption that they're making is that the things
            that
            are
            important to
            a huge $30 million business aren't necessarily important for getting a fledgling
            business off
            the
            ground. So what are some of the ways that Grasshopper today, or when you sold it in
            2015,
            differed from
            when it started?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so I think a lot of things changed,
            right,
            but when
            you're
            small, I think the things that don't matter as much are kind of structure and
            process.
            When you
            get
            bigger, those are critically important, because you can't be looking and touching
            everything at
            the
            time, right. We made a lot of mistakes, but I think one thing that is ignored early
            on,
            and I
            think is
            critical, is culture and core values and core purpose and really having a true
            culture
            that
            really
            exists. I wish we had done that earlier.</p>

            wasn't
            right. It
            just
            didn't feel right. And we spent a solid year figuring out what our core values were,
            talking
            about them,
            okay, making sure the right people were on the bus. That took us more than a year.

            that was
            in the

            that you want people to operate on is fascinating, because when you're only one or

            people,
            then
            culture just sort of evolves naturally out of whatever your personality is, because
            you
            represent such a
            high percentage of the people there, but if you grow, and you don't set a culture
            deliberately,
            then one
            kind of forms on its own, and it might be unhealthy or something that you don't

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it takes a lot of time and a lot of
            effort.
            And I
            think
            actually getting real core values is actually very hard, right. Lots of people can
            write
            honesty
            and
            respect and things like that, but having real core values that are meaningful and
            actually
            represent not
            just what you want but what you are, and you're right, it comes from the founders.
            So
            our core
            values
            were go above and beyond, always entrepreneurial, radically passionate and your
            team. It
            spelled
            out
            GARY. We had fun with it, right. But we pounded people over the head with this. In
            the
            hiring
            process,
            this was the very first questions, right. Like, how do you apply yourself to these
            core
            values,
            right,
            and give stories around them. In the rewards and recognition process, we had
            quarterly,
            and then
            we
            moved to yearly reviews. Long story why we did that, it's not really relevant until
            you're kind
            of
            30-plus people. But, you know, every period where we reviewed each other, we talked
            about core
            values.
            Our monthly meetings, we presented gifts and rewards around the core values, who
            showed
            this the
            most,
            right. We had an I-caught program, where people could catch other people showing
            these
            core
            values,
            right.</p>

            that's kind
            of similar but perhaps more individualistic, but it's the psychology behind being a
            founder,
            which is
            questions like how do you manage your mental state and make sure that you're the
            best
            that you
            can be?
            And I think a lot of people underestimate how much of a role this plays, maybe just
            'cause it's
            hard to
            measure and that's why I love talking about it, 'cause it's so rarely discussed, but
            there are
            all sorts
            of things for developing this kind of personal culture. Like, what's your philosophy
            on
            work-life
            balance, for example, and how do you deal with scheduling your work? How do you
            maintain
            motivation and
            get yourself up in the morning? Or on the flip side, how do you deal with burnout or
            depression?
            So what
            are your thoughts. Did you have any guiding personal philosophies for how to manage
            your
            own
            psychology
            as a founder?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Sure, yeah, so I mean, I think there's a lot in
            that
            question, and
            so yeah, first, I don't believe that there is such thing as work-life balance, I
            think
            there's
            work-life
            integration, right, which means, you know, I work at times that doesn't make sense,
            right. Like,
            maybe
            I'll interrupt dinner, or I'll work at home, or whatever it is, right, or on
            vacation,
            because I
            think
            as you integrate things, you have more flexibility and freedom, compared with
            regimenting things
            and
            saying I can't work after 7 p.m. Or, you know, I'm going on vacation, and I'm not
            gonna
            look at
            emails,
            right. I think those extreme things really don't help. And there's this culture of,
            you
            know, I
            only
            look at my inbox once a day or bullshit like that. No, like, real people that have
            to
            get real
            things
            done. Do look at it more and should look at it more. Sorry, right. So I think that
            it's
            about
            integration. I think personal health is very important. If you can't treat your
            personal
            health
            and
            eating right, which initially I was all wrong with. I was eating all the wrong
            foods. I
            wasn't
            exercising. I was gaining weight, right, because I'm in the office. I'm working. I'm
            stressed.
            So I made
            major changes there. That had a clear impact. I think waking up early is the biggest
            advantage
            any
            entrepreneur could ever have, right. If I wake up at 5 a.m. and everyone else wakes
            up
            at 8
            a.m., I
            gained three hours on everyone, right. And that's a magic three hours, where A,
            there's
            much
            less
            distraction, right. There's less emails. There's less phone calls. There's less
            people
            asking
            for
            things. But most other people are not getting up at 5 a.m. and working, right. And
            that's how
            you win,
            plain and simple, right. Like, that's how you win. There's no magic. There's nothing
            else. So I
            think
            that's very important. I think the last piece to your question, and I'm kind of
            trying
            to
            remember each
            piece. So if I forget something, definitely ask me.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I think the other piece is as
            entrepreneurs,
            we have
            two
            selves, right. One which is our public self, which we have to present to our
            employees,
            our
            partners,
            our vendors, which is overly optimistic, right, no matter what, We're gonna
            persevere
            through
            anything,
            right, even when the real reality might not match that, but we have to, we need to
            face
            the real
            reality, but we need to present an image of we're gonna get past this and here's why
            and
            here's
            my plan,
            right, with here may be times where you go through this roller coaster, and you're
            at
            the bottom
            of that
            kind of slide, and things are very negative, or you really don't believe that the
            next
            step is
            possible,
            and I think the only way to deal with that is to have peers around you that you can
            discuss
            those things
            with, and they're other entrepreneurs, right, because it's hard to discuss it with
            your
            family,
            because
            there may be real financial impact to sharing something like, "Oh my God, I can't
            believe we
            might not
            be able to meet payroll next week," right. So it's hard to share it with family.
            It's
            very hard
            to share
            with employees sometimes, right, until there's more maturity in the business. But in
            the
            early
            days,
            like, I couldn't imagine sharing those problems, right. But finding a peer group of
            other
            entrepreneurs
            facing the same problems and being able to comfortably share them, I think that's
            how
            you get
            through
            the non-public image of entrepreneurship.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Everything you said is awesome. And I just love
            talking
            about this
            stuff. The first thing that you said, it sounds like you're really focused. All
            right,
            it was
            when you
            were talking about work-life integration, rather than work-life balance, which got
            me
            thinking
            about the
            fact, and not everybody is like this, maybe it's just me, but for me, one of the
            things
            that I
            prioritize the most in my life is flexibility. Because what your business needs, for
            example, is
            not
            always going to fit on this perfect nine-to-five schedule, and it's similar with
            your
            mental
            state. What
            you feel motivated to do at any given time is not going to always fit into this
            perfectly
            organized box.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Exactly, and, you know, there is actually such
            a
            thing as
            being a
            workaholic, or being addicted, and I understand why people want to have these strict
            separations, but I
            think sometimes, it's kind of an overreaction, right. You're trying to live your
            entire
            life on
            a rigid
            schedule with strict delineations and time blocks, with your work between 10 and
            six,
            and you
            leisure
            time on Saturdays at 2 p.m. It just, for me at least, just doesn't work that well.
            It
            just
            doesn't
            naturally fit into how I feel and in what my business needs. But another thing that
            you
            talked
            about,
            that I thought was interesting, was waking up early. In most of my previous
            projects,
            pretty
            much for
            the last 10 years of my life actually, I've had this night owl programmer schedule,
            where I'll
            stay up
            late coding and wake up late. But with Indie Hackers, I wake up super early, and
            it's a
            different
            business, to be honest, because I spend so much of my time talking to people,
            answering
            emails,
            tweeting, sales calls with sponsors, et cetera, and I think part of me waking up
            early
            is that I
            moved
            in with my girlfriend who likes going to bed early and waking up early, et cetera,
            but
            also part
            of it
            is that I'm on the West Coast, and if I wake up at 10 a.m., then half the day's
            already
            gone on
            the East
            Coast effectively. So it's kind of a natural thing. If I'm actually doing my job
            right
            and
            talking to
            people, then I'm gonna feel pressure to wake up early anyway.</p>

            and the
            company
            was on the East Coast, right. So a 10 a.m. meeting was a 7 a.m. meeting for me,
            right.
            And so
            even more
            so, waking up early was important, because now everything had shifted by three hours
            naturally,
            so now
            if I wanted time that was more quiet or focused, I had to wake up even earlier,
            right.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Another thing that you talked about was having
            peers around
            you who
            were entrepreneurs themselves, because you can share with them a lot more easily
            what's
            going
            on, and
            they can understand you better than other people who haven't really been in the
            trenches. And I
            think a
            lot of people listening, including myself, are solo founders. We don't have
            co-founders.
            That's
            not
            really even an option. And a lot of us don't even have employees. So I think that
            having
            some
            sort of
            other source for a community is crucial. And what's helped me personally is this
            trend
            towards
            transparency. So for example, I can hop on Twitter, and you certainly could not have
            done this
            in 2003,
            2004, but I can tweet out a decision like, "Hey, I'm recording a podcast. Which of
            these
            topics
            sound
            the most interesting to you guys?" Or last week, I tweeted, "Hey, I'm having trouble
            with my
            affiliate
            marketing program. What am I doing wrong?" And the amount of amazing support and
            feedback that I
            got
            from people was staggering. Everyone jumped in and had different opinions for what I
            could do.
            And I
            think from a practical standpoint, obviously, getting this kind of advice is good,
            but
            even from
            a
            psychological or an emotional standpoint, just having other people who've been
            through
            what
            you're going
            through makes it way easier when something goes wrong, because it doesn't feel like
            you're
            completely
            alone. And I think a lot of founders who haven't found a community, who aren't on
            the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum" target="_blank">Indie Hackers
                forum</a> or
            aren't
            on
            Twitter and don't have people to talk to, end up getting sad or quitting or getting
            depressed,
            because
            they just don't have anyone to share with. On a different note, I'm really curious
            about
            how you
            sold
            Grasshopper, because when it comes to selling, there's always two questions that I
            have.
            Now you
            ended
            up selling to Citrix in 2015, and one question is why Citrix? And the other
            question, I
            think,
            is a
            little bit more interesting, but it's why sell at all? Because at this point, you've
            been
            running
            Grasshopper for 12 years. Your business was incredibly successful, and I'm sure it
            felt
            a little
            bit
            like it was your baby. I've only been running Indie Hackers for five months, and I
            already feel
            like
            it's part of my identity, so I can't even imagine 12 years. What kind of framework
            did
            you have
            in your
            mind for determining when to sell?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, great question. So first, from day one,
            we
            never had
            an exit
            plan. People kind of asked us this question, and they kind of thought we were crazy.
            We
            were
            like "What
            do you mean exit plan?" Like, we're building a business, because we want a great
            place
            to work.
            And we
            think we're solving a real problem. Like, why do we need an exit plan, right? Part
            of
            this was
            we were
            also bootstrap, so we were never pressured by VCs or others to have a,
            quote-unquote,
            exit plan.
            So we
            never expected to sell the business, quite honestly. Citrix approached us. The
            process
            took over
            a year
            from when they first approached us to when we sold it. There were a lot of reasons
            that
            it was a
            good
            fit. I think the timing made sense. As founders, we had been in the business for 11
            years. All
            of our
            personal wealth we had generated was in the business, right. We had no reason we
            needed
            to sell.
            You
            know, we drove the cars we wanted, or car, I should say. We lived in the house we
            wanted
            to live
            in. We
            didn't have extreme lifestyles, but we had the stuff we wanted, right, and, you
            know, I
            think
            that's, as
            being an entrepreneur, that's kind of part of the goal, right, is to have the
            flexibility and to
            have
            what you want, not to have crazy things but just have what you want, right. So there
            was
            no
            reason to
            sell. But as we went through the process, we found more and more of a fit with
            Citrix.
            You know,
            culturally, they believed in keeping the name Grasshopper, that brand which we cared
            about. They
            cared
            about the employees and keeping them. And end of the day, the monetary and structure
            of
            the deal
            made
            enough sense that it was impossible to say no to, right. And I think that the best
            outcome is
            when
            you're not looking for that. And it worked out very well for us, and the companies
            still
            thrives
            today
            within Citrix.</p>

            of five
            other people that were running the business, and that's part of the reason Citrix

            and
            partially, you
            know, by mistake. We hired people to fill in the gaps for the things we didn't like
            doing. Over
            time,
            those people got better and better at doing those things, so there was no reason to
            have
            us
            around as
            much. I then moved out of the office, so being remote kind of forced more of that.
            And,
            honestly, the
            team we had was just an amazing team, and I love all of those people that have been
            involved in
            really
            set us up for success and did the things that, as founders, we could never have

            brought
            structure
            to the business, brought process, brought years of experience in other organizations

            in a
            financial
            situation that is, I'm assuming, pretty good, and in some ways, that limits what you
            can
            do. It
            limits
            what's even worth working on, but obviously, it also gives you the ability to work
            on
            things
            that you
            never could've earlier.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so I spent a year kind of thinking about
            that, doing
            a lot of
            different stuff. I spent some time with 500 Startups and helping out with their
            Mountain
            View
            accelerator program, so working with some companies there. I've made a ton of angel
            investments,
            both
            prior and-- And now really, I've come to the realization, about a year-and-a-half
            after
            the
            sale, what
            we're gonna do is we want to buy a SaaS business, preferably in the SMB space, but
            we'll
            look at
            any
            SaaS business that's doing between half-a-million to a million or more in annual
            revenue. And
            we're
            gonna buy it and scale it, like we have. So that's gonna be our next step, and we'll
            still do
            investments and other stuff, but honestly, I've slowed down my angel investing and
            really
            targeted very
            specifically to companies like Groove, that I made an investment in, who is both
            profitable and
            didn't
            need the investment but was looking for both advice and structure in certain areas,
            and,
            you
            know,
            different, very specific things, and in doing so, those are the types of investments
            that I'll
            be making
            more of.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so I get this question a lot, and I've
            thought about
            it so
            many times. And one part of me felt like my advice should change over time maybe,
            right,
            like,
            because
            things change, industry changes, but I keep coming back to the same thing, which is
            I
            think the
            best
            piece of advice is just go out and do something, anything, right. Rather than talk
            about
            it,
            rather
            than, you know, wait and see what users think, just do something, right, because I
            would
            prefer
            to see
            an entrepreneur fail at something than fail at doing nothing, right. And I think
            that
            today we
            spend so
            much time reading, and there's so many resources, right. I could say go here, go
            there.
            There
            are so
            many great resources, blogs and podcasts and everything else. We can consume so much
            information
            that we
            get into this paralysis of like okay, like, all right, I need to know my next seven
            steps. Like,
            no,
            just do one step and do something, right. If it's build a product, if it's talk to a
            customer,
            if it's
            sell something, collect a credit card, like just each little step, just keep doing
            them,
            right.

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I meet a lot of people who are, they've

            contemplating
            starting a business forever, and they're just consuming things, and they never
            really
            get around
            to
            actually starting. And so I think in terms of bang-for-your-buck advice, that's
            probably
            the
            most
            valuable just because of the sheer number of people who are on the fence.</p>

            these
            three hacks
            or go do this, right. But in reality, I think if you're doing something, you're
            getting
            up early
            in the
            day, and you're working hard, you'll find something that you both love and is
            successful. It may
            take a
            few failures. It may take time. There's no magic to it, but if you combine those
            things,
            you're
            at least
            on the right path. If you're not doing anything, and you have a schedule, and you're

            well,
