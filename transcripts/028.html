        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Welcome to the Indie Hackers Podcast. I'm Courtland Allen, from <a
                href="http://indiehackers.com" class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a>, and on this show
            I talk to the founders of profitable Internet businesses to try to get a sense of how they got to where they
            are today, so that the rest of us can learn from their lessons and experiences.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Today, I'm talking to Wes Bos. He is a bit hard to describe, because he's so good at so many different
            things, and I'm sure a lot of you listening are rabid Wes Bos fans, just based on the number of questions
            and suggestions I got for this interview. There are very few introductions that I could do that would really
            do Wes justice, or even this episode justice. I think it's one of my favorite conversations that I've had on
            the podcast, so why don't we just jump right into it?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'm here today with Wes Bos. How's it going, Wes?</p>

            you've excelled at so many things. Your website, you describe yourself as a designer, a developer, an
            entrepreneur, a speaker, and a teacher, and I think usually people who use this many words to describe
            themselves are exaggerating, but you're actually at the top of your field in every single one of these
            areas, which is super cool.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Let me start by asking a tough question. If you had to pick just one of these to be good at, and all of the
            other areas you had to give up for good — they're just completely gone — what would you pick?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">All right. Well, I cut my teeth pretty early in the MySpace days, back
            when… I think it was about 17 years ago. I just did a whole podcast myself on my origin story, so I'm pretty
            fresh with it. About 17 years ago, I got into building my own websites. That moved into building MySpace
            designs, and that's where I really learned coding for different bands, and then from there I just started
            doing freelance consulting, all the way through high school and through university, and, by the time I got
            out of university, I was running my own business, doing consulting.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Right around that time, I got into teaching, something called Ladies Learning Code here in Toronto. We did
            weekend workshops, learning how to use WordPress, and that just compounded into me understanding that I love
            to teach. One thing — lots of blog posts, YouTube videos, lots of other teaching — led to another, and
            that's where I became… I don't know. The blog posts and the videos lent itself to lots of traffic, which I
            decided I wanted to write a book about. We can talk about that more, if you like, but I wrote this book on
            sublime text, and that was my first product, and I was hooked since then. That's my beginning story and
            where I'm at right now.</p>

            me, and then you react to that, which is funny, because part of my success was a react series. I'm a dad, by

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">There's two main things that I use to measure my success and how things
            are going. The first one is mostly signup numbers and sales numbers. How many people are signing up for free
            courses? How many people are signing up or paying for the paid courses? Really, the thing that keeps me
            going is those small, little emails that I get, where people have got a new job or they've broken into the
            industry, taken a couple of my courses and actually landed themselves a new job. Someone got a $15,000 raise
            just a couple weeks ago. It's pretty crazy to think that, "Oh, wow! They've just learned a skill that you've
            taught them, and they've then taken that and turned it into some sort of betterment of their life."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's the cheesy aspect of it, but the hard and fast numbers part of it is… I don't know. What do we have
            here? My paid courses, all together, probably have somewhere around almost 30,000 paid users, between my
            four big paid courses, which is Sublime Text Power User, React for Beginners, Learn Node, and ES6 for
            Everyone. My most popular one is React for Beginners. That one has 14,000 paid people that have taken it.
            Then they trickle down from there. That's been my main driver there. Then I also have my free courses, which
            is how a lot of people hear about me. Those go from… I don't know. I think my lowest one probably has about
            10,000 signups. Then, my highest one is JavaScript30, which currently has 108,201 people who have signe up
            for that course.</p>

            a little bit cheesy, but I think it's underestimated as a factor that keeps you going as an entrepreneur. I
            mean, just looking at the people that I've talked to and the people that I interact with on a regular basis,
            I think one of the top reasons that people end up failing when they try to start a business is simply that
            they quit early. That could be for a whole number of reasons, right? They lose motivation. They run out of
            money. Things aren't working. Getting positive messages in your inbox from people that you're actually
            affecting… There's nothing that's more of a shot in the arm than that.</p>

            probably four or five years. Then, I've been on Twitter for about 11 years now, and I've got 100,000 people
            following me on there. That's been pretty important with establishing credibility and meeting people and
            just having great conversations, in terms of what people are looking for in courses. Those are my big

            it's safe to say that you've traveled a considerable distance down the path of success as an entrepreneur. A
            lot of people listening in want to build an online business like you, but they're still in the early phases.
            They're trying to decide what to work on. They're trying to figure out how to get their product out the door
            or find their very first customers, so it'd be great to hear about your early phases. What's the story

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so probably for… I don't know you can look back at my YouTube and
            look at some of my early screencasts. I think it all stemmed from me not wanting to create a course. I
            didn't even know that was a thing. It was just me blogging and creating YouTube videos about things that I
            had learned or questions that people have asked me, and then I went and wrote a blog post about it or I went
            up and created a YouTube video.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            From helping people, from writing all of these blog posts, some of them got really, really popular. Some of
            them didn't. People really appreciated it. I was also very, very in the IRC. Back before we had Slack, we
            had IRC, which, if people had questions about JavaScript, I would help them. I was just all about spending a
            good chunk of my day helping people out, in terms of how they can get through their coding, because when I
            had first started learning how to code, even still today, if I have a question about something, it's amazing
            when someone can take a little bit of time out of their day and explain something to you or find the issue
            with what's going on. That's really what I spent a lot of my time on, and that's really how I got a lot of
            my substantial boost, before I even thought about making a course.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then, how did I get the first dollar? Well, I had written all these blog posts about Sublime Text, and they
            were getting lots of traffic. When you write a popular tech blog post, every single publisher out there
            comes knocking on your door, asking if you'll write a book for them. At the time, I was thrilled, but I soon
            learned that writing a book with a tech publisher is a bum deal, and you don't make much money on it at all.
            You do it more for speaking engagements and client services and stuff like that, which both of those I
            already had, so I wasn't really all that interested in.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I decided to write the book myself, and I recorded some screencasts, as well as wrote the entire book, and I
            self-published it, and I just put it out there. From the email signup that I had on my Sublime Text blog
            posts, I had about 2000 people, and, of that, about 300 people bought it within the first day or two. That
            was my first like, "Whoa! This actually works!"</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, the absolute biggest one was that if somebody else has already
            done it, then there's no point in actually doing it. That's because when I had written my Sublime book, or
            even when I try to write a blog post, I would always be like, "Oh, there's already a blog post about this
            out there. Maybe it's not worth it," right? I pushed past that and put it out anyway, and I realized,
            sometimes people don't jive well with what's already out there. Sometimes people really like the way that
            you explain something, or maybe they like it because yours is up to date. Whatever reason somebody likes
            yours better is all the reason you need in order to try to put something out yourself.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Of all of my courses out there, there's equivalent courses. There's tons of equivalent courses. There's way
            cheaper courses that are out there, but that doesn't stop me anymore, because I know there's a lot of people
            out there that like… There's a lot of people out there that don't like my stuff, and that's totally fine
            with me, but I know that there's also a crew of people who also like my stuff and are chomping down the
            doors. Is that a saying? They're beating down the door to get whatever it is that I release next.</p>

            shouldn't worry about the competition. You shouldn't shy away from tackling a problem, just because somebody

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Another thing that I often tell people, and I'm glad I have you on here
            today, because you're the perfect person to tell me whether or not this is good advice… I tell people, who
            are trying to get started, that one of the best things that they can do is start by teaching. It doesn't
            have to be teaching in the most traditional sense. I mean, sure, you can start courses or video tutorials,
            but you can also start an interview site, like Indie Hackers, or a podcast, or you could even just aggregate
            raw data on a topic and tell people who are doing research. A good example of that is Nomad List, which
            started off as a Google spreadsheet full of information on cities that digital nomads like to travel to.
            Regardless of the format, I think helping people learn something is one of the best ways to get your start
            as an entrepreneur. I've got four or five different reasons why I think this is the case, and I'm curious
            what your thoughts are on each one of them.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The first one is a perfect segue from what we were just talking about, and it's this: Almost no matter what
            you teach, you're not going to have to worry about the competition, and nobody's really going to have the
            market completely cornered. The reason for that is that people have different learning styles. Some people
            like learning in classroom settings. Some people like reading blog posts. Some people like audio. Some
            people like hands-on exercises. Some people prefer textbooks, et cetera. Teaching is almost never a
            winner-take-all market, just because there's so many different solutions to the problem of people wanting to
            know something, and you can always add your own solution to that list.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Reason number two is pretty closely related, and that's that it's relatively easy to come up with an idea
            for teaching. You have to start with something that you know very well or that you're willing to learn
            yourself, so that you can actually teach it. Then you just need to get a little bit creative with building a
            product or a service that helps people learn. As a teacher yourself, what do you think about this, so far,
            and is this a good place for entrepreneurs to start?</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think so. I think the first point, in that the market isn't cornered,
            sometimes I see people come out with stuff that is very obtuse, so they don't necessarily know if there's a
            market there or not. That's where I'd encourage people to write blog posts or make YouTube videos on maybe
            three or four different topics, and then you will clearly see which ones there's interest are by the number
            of views that that thing has. If people aren't sharing it, if people aren't watching it, maybe it's not
            something that people are all that interested in, or it's not a problem that they actually have to be
            solved.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that's exactly right, and that's literally my third point, is
            that you can get your minimum viable product out in very little time. You don't actually have to build an
            entire course to get started. You can just start with one or two blog posts or a YouTube video, just like
            you said, and measure the results, and actually get practice in marketing it and figuring out how people
            react to it. That's another great reason to start teaching.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Number four, and this is a big one, especially for developers — well, only for developers — but there's not
            that much code involved in teaching. You're generally just writing, and so you can get a blog post or video
            out the door in a day and start trying to sell it immediately or start trying to market it immediately, and
            you don't fall into this black hole that a lot of people do of spending six months, basically just building
            a product without any idea whether or not people are going to like it.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I'm on that, as well. I think that there is sometimes a bit of…
            In this whole Internet marketing space, I think that there's a lot of people that don't focus on quality
            content all that much. They're more focused on building their email list or all these marketing techniques.
            What happens is that they just crank out some PDF or some crappy course or something like that, and then
            they go nuts with all the tactics. They listen to 300 Mixergy interviews or something like that and start
            going to town with the different tactics, when, at the core of what I do is very good content. Then, the
            marketing and all the techniques are just on top of that, to expose the very good content. Yes, go quick
            with your stuff and crank out a blog post in a day, but also make sure that it's good, as well.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, totally agree. I think that's the other end of the spectrum. It's
            either spending way too much time on what you're building, to the point where it actually isn't good. You
            spend so much time without talking to anybody that you are investing in something that's not good. The other
            extreme is spending way to little time and focusing too much on the tactics. That's great advice.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The fifth point is: I think that if you know something well enough to
            teach it, you're probably a lot more likely to be passionate about it. A lot of people end up starting these
            businesses that seem very opportunistic. They see a gap in the market and their like, "I'm going to do
            that." It turns out they're selling bibs to babies in Taiwan, or something they don't care about. After a
            month or two, they're like, "Oh, this is exhausting. I'm tired." If you're teaching something that you know
            very well, you're a lot more likely to enjoy it and stick with it when things get tough, and you're actually
            reaching people, who are interested in the same topic that you're interested in. I can't overstate how
            important it is to be motivated about what you're working on.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Oh, yeah. I totally agree with that. Often, I'll get approached by
            companies, who have a, "We convert Microsoft Excel documents to nice-looking tables," or something, and they
            want me to do a tutorial on it or something like that, or a whole series, or even something that is
            tangentially related to what I do. It might be still web development and whatnot, but it's just I'm just not
            excited about that, and that's not going to make a very good course, and there's no way that I'm going to be
            in that for the long haul. I only pick up stuff that I'm super excited about. Even if I don't know it as
            100%, I'll definitely be excited about it and know quite a bit about it and know that I'm in a good spot to
            start teaching it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Then the last point, which I think will be a good segue into what I
            want to talk to you about next: Teaching is a great way to build an audience. There are just so many people
            in the market to learn something. People are always learning, and if you can teach them successfully and
            help them actually learn what they're trying to learn, then that's a very personal experience, especially if
            you're doing something like video or audio. The people that you teach will trust you. They will follow you.
            They'll want to hear more about what you have to say, and building that kind of engaged audience is really
            the secret to serial entrepreneurship and launching products in the future that succeed.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Because back when MySpace was a thing, the way that MySpace worked is
            that you would add friends, and whoever had the most friends, you'd get put in people's top aid and whatnot,
            and, at the time, I was designing T-shirts for bands, and I was designing CD art, and I was doing MySpace
            designs, and how do you reach people? Well, you build up a large following on MySpace. I spent years on
            MySpace. I think I had about 20,000 friends on MySpace, which is hilarious to think about.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            As cringy as that was, it clearly showed me that I was dealing with bands from all over the world, and they
            were sending checks to my house when I was just in high school, so I definitely realized the benefits of
            growing an audience. Then, when Twitter came along, I was like, this is the same thing, but just a different
            platform, and how do you build a huge following? On MySpace, you just had to click the Add Friend button
            20,000 times, but on Twitter, it's a one-way relationship, so you actually have to offer something of value,
            in order for people to want to follow you.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I had started, just by talking a lot about web development. The thing that I do is called "Hot Tips" where,
            if I have a little tip about coding, I'll take a screenshot of it, and I'll explain how it works, and it's
            just enough for someone to read it over a minute and go, "Huh, didn't know that," or "Huh, that's a neat way
            to approach it." It's just a little bite in your day, and that's what people come to Twitter about. I think
            that a lot of people think that Twitter is all about pushing content or about pushing their thing, but it's
            really about helping people and being part of a conversation, especially to developers, because developers
            have very high bullshit detectors. If you're just queuing up your Buffer or Edgar with 20,000 articles on
            web development, no one's going to follow you or no one's going to get any value from that, but if you're
            actually creating… If you meet people where they're at, like on Twitter, with good quality content and not
            try to push them off Twitter every single tweet, then it's going to work for you.</p>

            approach something or different tools that are in there. I've been at it so long that it's like second
            nature; whereas, something like Facebook… I haven't logged in, in a week and a half, and I have to make sure

            replies to other people, and you should be joining in on conversations about different tools and your
            thoughts on things and whatnot. You can also… What I used to do is I would just have these different
            queries. I have TweetDeck open, and you can search for different things, like Need Help or… I forget was the
            query was that I was looking for, but people would ask for help, and you can just jump in and provide some
            help on what it is that they're looking. There's a lot of people asking questions on Twitter, and if you can
            jump in and help somebody, they're definitely going to respect you for that and most likely give you a
            follow.</p>

            where people hang out. If you are on Twitter every day, you can get an idea of what's new, what's going on.
            What are people struggling with? What are the questions that people have? You can just get a feel for where

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, email is good, because you can get a lot more. I have 100,000
            followers on Twitter, but if I tweet something out, eight people see it. I don't know, not eight, but it's
            very low, the amount of people that actually see your tweet versus how many followers you have; whereas, you
            send an email out, and half your list is actually going to see it versus probably 1% or 2% of your following
            on Twitter, so you have a much higher ability. When I have something very important to send out, I'll send
            that out on my email list. Then, my Twitter is more like pumping things up, talking about it; whereas, your
            email list is, " I've got something to say. Here's what you should know about it."</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then, another thing I use on my email list is I'll often just send out — this is terrible for my inbox — but
            I just say, "Hey, what are you struggling with? What's going on right now?" People are a lot more vulnerable
            when they send a one-to-one email, especially if you write it in a tone of… I don't know. My emails are
            often written in a tone of like, "Hey, I just was on vacation, having some good times. Here's the
            technologies that I'm playing with right now. By the way, what are you struggling with right now?" or, "What
            are you hoping to learn in the next six months?" I'm like, "Just hit reply," and I'll get hundreds and
            hundreds of replies from people. Sometimes it will be just a book about their whole career journey and where
            they're stuck right now. That is very good, because you can take that and, both, use the wording that
            they've used in the copy of your website and also know what to teach next, because you have your finger on
            the pulse of what people are having trouble with.</p>

            emails that I write are a sentence or two, but most of the emails that I get are where people are just
            requesting quick things. Every now and then, you get a little book from people, and you read it and try to
            respond as empathetic as you can.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that's a great question. I have always worked for myself, and
            that's a huge advantage, because that allows me to take part of my day and, right now I work full-time on
            building my courses, but up until about eight months ago, I was doing client work for a good chunk of the
            day and building my courses in another part of the day, and I would just make sure that I section off time
            to work on it, because it's so easy to be like, "Well, this client work or my job will pay me now, but this
            course might pay me someday? Maybe, but probably not? I don't know." Chunking off time and being able to
            risk a couple hours a day, whether that means your income is going to go down or not while you try out
            building something, that's totally fine.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I don't know. Just over the years, I've spent less time on client work and more time on my own courses. As
            that boat gets closer to the dock, there's a time that you can jump for that. For those who have a full-time
            job and are looking at trying to do this, I don't know. I am very good about not doing work outside of work
            hours. I only work 9:00 to 5:00. I don't take my laptop downstairs and stuff like that. I don't know how I
            would do it, if I hadn't started this before I had kids, because there's definitely almost no time in the
            day, when you have a young family like that. I don't know. I think you have to carve some time out, whether
            it's early in the morning or whether on your lunch break or whether you can negotiate something with your
            partner about working a couple hours in the evening on it, just because you think that it will make a big
            difference in your life.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">One thing that I have… I actually haven't used it in a while. When I
            launch a course, or when I launch a free course, I'll probably get hundreds of tweets being like, "Oh, this
            is amazing," or people sharing it out, people doing a really great thing and sharing it with a friend, and I
            really want to say thank you to absolutely everybody, so what I built was this massive thing, where I would
            type RT, and it would type out random thanks. Then it would go into my database of 40 or 50 different thank
            you messages and send them one of those thank you messages.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            When I tell people that, they go, "Oh, that's so skeazy and scammy. Why would you automate saying thank
            you?" but I want to say thank you to all of these people, but I just don't have the time or the mental
            energy to figure out what to actually say thank you for, so I created this little text expander snippet that
            would randomly grab a thank you, that it gives them the time of day and says, "Thank you for doing this."
            Often what that will do is start or spark a real conversation with the person, which you can then go back
            and forth with them on, on Twitter, not as a robot.</p>

            Whether you like the term "growth hacker" or not, the whole idea behind that is you're able to get into your
            product and try things. Often that requires fundamental changes to your code base or different checks inside
            of your code base, at some point. If you can code those things yourself…</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            An example is that I recently rolled out Purchasing Power Discounts, meaning that, depending on which
            country you come from, some countries around the world have very low purchasing power in the U.S. dollar,
            and my courses are a week or a month's worth of income for them, so the course is cheaper for them. I was
            able to go into my code base, detect which country they're coming from and offer up a coupon code, and then
            also restrict those coupon codes by the country that they're coming from. Most people wouldn't be able to do
            that. A lot of people come to me and they just have this rat's nest of Zapier put together that it's too
            brittle to be able to try these things out quickly. Yeah, I'm sure you could hire a developer for that, as
            well, but that's expensive.</p>

            starts from a working state, and then you can add things on and keep it working along the way; whereas, if

            able to get it to a point where it is working, and it's secure, and you handle all of these different
            things. I've built my own platform, and it's taken years to build. I definitely would say, get to know

            bootcamps, but those are almost all developers, who learned the hard way. A bootcamp is a great way to spend
            — I don't know — a couple months just getting up to speed on it. Then, if you have a year or whatever after

            that powers my courses is called , and what that does is it powers every single domain name for each course.
            I do it a little bit different. I launch a new domain name for every course, and then it has an affiliate
            system built into it. It has a country code, discounts built into it. It's got a bunch of reporting, bunch
            of tax reporting for myself, the ability to… What else does it have in it? Obviously, sell the products,
            charge the credit cards. It has the whole delivering of the product, being able to download the videos or
            stream them online and keep track of your progress.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's just all of these different things coming together. I initially built it because I had released a book
            and videos, and there was no platform out there, at the time, that did both of those. I'm sure there's
            really great platforms out there now, that you can launch a video course, without having to write a single
            line of code, but I'm really glad that I did, because I have full control over both the user experience,
            like how they view the course, as well as being able to try different marketing techniques out.</p>

            each of my free courses, and it was just a nightmare to maintain; whereas, now I can launch to, I think,
            it's about seven or eight different domain names. I sold stickers a while ago, which had to be shipped to

            of these issues that real world applications will hit, because that makes me a better teacher, and I can

            blog posts, I was like, "Why would they ask me? I surely don't know a whole lot about this topic," but you
            come to realize you, as a developer, if you've been doing this for a couple years, you do actually know
            quite a bit of stuff. If you can master the one topic that you're talking about, especially if, as you teach
            things, you realize you don't know it as well as you thought you did, and that makes you figure it out
            really, really well. I don't know. I think that just being like, "Ah, I don't know everything," I'm probably
            not the best person in the world, but I am really good at explaining things, and people seem to like the way
            that I explain things, and I know it well enough to build my own stuff, so here is how I understand it and
            here's how I would build something. People seem to learn well from that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I think that when I first started, you assume that, because
            they're simple to you, they're simple to everybody. That's absolutely not the case. They're very complicated
            to people. Often I will simplify something, or often I won't take in a third party dependency that really
            convolutes it, or whatever, because… A good example is, a lot of times people, in a Node application or a
            React application, will create tons and tons of index.js files and put them in, import and export, and
            string things along, and create all kinds of stuff, where it's very hard to understand how can I even trace
            what's going on in this application?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Often, my courses are a lot less files, and they're often simplified, so that it's very easy to understand
            what's going on. I think that's what I've learned, is that developers often overcomplicate things, and
            that's a huge reason for people being confused. If you can really simplify it, and not dumb it down, but if
            you can work at how do I simplify this and how do I explain this in such a way that regular people can
            understand it, people will really enjoy it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, absolutely. I had been teaching in person for… I think, also,
            teaching in person is the best, because if you just start a course and record it and give it to people, you
            don't see the confused look on people's face, and you don't see people dumping the course halfway through
            because they're frustrated or whatever. By teaching in person, you can really get a good idea of what people
            are struggling with and what the common trip-ups in coding are.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            As I was teaching in person, I often had people coming to me, asking, "How do I get better at JavaScript? I
            need help. I just need more stuff to work on," like, "I get it. This exercise was great. How do I do it
            again? What do I build?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I always have tons of ideas, so I had been keeping a list of extra little exercises that would be good for
            people, and as I built that up, I thought, this would be a really great series of every day you build one
            thing. It's Vanilla JavaScript, which is totally against the grain right now, because there's no frameworks,
            no compilers, no libraries, no boilerplate. It's just JavaScript. People are overwhelmed with everything
            that's going on right now, so I thought this would be great. I think it took me about a year and a half to
            build up a list of 30 different fun exercises, something that was fun and real world enough that you're
            going to learn something, but small enough that you could do it in 20 minutes, an hour, however long it
            takes you to watch the video and to do it yourself.</p>

            once I had 30, or once I had about 50 of them, I went through every single one, decided which ones would be
            good for videos, picked 30 of those, and then I went through every single one and just made it slick,
            polished it, made the HTML and CSS look really good, made it make sense, made sure I used these in the
            latest ES6 stuff in it, so people can get a chance to work with that. Then I had 30 things that I was
            building, and I recorded all 30 of them, and I launched it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            As I'm doing this, I'm pumping it up on Twitter. I always post screenshots and little GIFs of what it is,
            and the hype was pretty big behind it. By the time I launched it, I launched it to my email list and on
            Twitter, and people are pretty excited about it.</p>

            until I had totally done everything, and then launched that one. How long did that take? I think, from the
            point of having that list of 50 rough exercises to launching, was about three or four months full-time. It
            was a huge undertaking. It seems like I just turn on my recorder and start playing, but they're very
            polished. They make sure that they're following best practices. All of them look really nice. They've all
            been designed, so, yeah, it's about three or four months, start to finish, from having the ideas and some of

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I think people need to know that it's coming, so I often will
            email once or twice in the coming month to hype it up. Then, when it's time to launch, you write an email
            about what the course is, what it's going to help you with. Then, also what I do is I often do what's called
            a hard ask. I'll say, "Hey, I legit just spent four months working on this thing. It would mean the world to
            me if you could tweet it out, or if you could send it to a friend or a coworker." Then, when you sign up for
            the course, it also says, " Everybody's signed up for a hundred courses and never taken them. Don't make
            this the course that you just shelf. Commit to it publicly. Post on Twitter. Ask if"… I encourage people to
            get what's called an accountabilibuddy, where you do it with a friend, so you can keep each other
            accountable. That was huge, as well. It doesn't make you share it on Twitter, but it asks nicely, and tells
            you to commit to it publicly, and that helped a lot.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think that it was just don't ask people what they want. I guess I
            have asked people what they want, but nobody told me, "I would like 30 days of JavaScript problems to
            solve." It was more listening to people, who were overwhelmed with frameworks and compilers, who were
            overwhelmed with React, and all these new things, where they didn't have any sort of solid foundation to
            build on, or they had been using jQuery for all these years, and they didn't feel that strong with Vanilla
            JavaScript. From all of those things, I thought, well, you could get better, if you just did a whole bunch
            of work and did a whole bunch of exercises with it, but there was nothing out there that was concrete, and
            you just put it in your lap to work on it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think listening to what people's pain points are really helps me figure out how this… This one has
            absolutely blown up. It's exactly what a lot of people needed, and I think because I had taught in person,
            and because I had been listening to what pain points were, it really hit a nerve and exploded.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I mean, it's everywhere, and I think your point about
            understanding what the actual pain points are, at their core, is so important, because, at the end of the
            day, like you said earlier, you can learn every marketing tactic in the book, but if the product that you
            build isn't any good, if it doesn't actually solve a pain point that a lot of people are looking for a
            solution to, it's like a negative multiplier on all of your marketing efforts and tactics.</p>

            be, you're not going to get anywhere, but if you start producing… For me, it was blog posts. I don't know if
            it's blog posts anymore. It's probably more YouTube videos or free courses or whatever. Just start producing
            stuff and get it out there. Start helping people, and you're going to figure out the rest along the way.</p>
