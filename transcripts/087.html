            listening to the Indie Hackers podcast. On this show I talk to the founders of profitable internet
            businesses and I try to get a sense of what it's like to be in their shoes. How did they get to where they
            are today?<br><br>
            How do they make decisions at their companies and in their personal lives? And what exactly makes their
            businesses tick? And the goal here, as always, is so that the rest of us can learn from their examples and
            go on to build our own successful businesses. On today's episode, I'm excited to be talking to you, the
            talented and mysterious AJ.<br><br>
            AJ is a creator of a number of various successful projects. Almost a decade ago he created HTML5 Up and to
            this day if you search for free HTML templates, AJ's site is right there on the first page of Google. His
            templates have been downloaded something like 12 million times.<br><br>
            He is the creator of Pixelarity, a similar website, but where instead of just giving his templates away for
            free, he actually sold them for money. And most famously, AJ is the creator of Carrd, which allows you to
            easily create a beautiful one-page website for pretty much anything your heart desires. So AJ, welcome to
            the show.</p>

            level of Carrd’s success? You're generating something close to $30,000 a month in revenue now. Every month,
            almost 20,000 new users sign up and create over 40,000 websites using Carrd.<br><br>
            And what's amazing is that you've built this thing by yourself in just a few years as a solo founder and a
            solo developer. I think that's crazy. Does that seem crazy to you? Are you ever amazed by what you've done?

            good thing to share early on because it's the early stages of a project that may or may not be
            proven.<br><br>
            And then when you get to that point where it's actually making it more than a few hundred dollars, that's
            good motivation for other people. It's good motivation for you. But once you get past a certain point in the
            five-figure range, I just feel it's, at least in my case, I feel it's a bit douchey. So that's why I don’t

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">But then there's business where no one really bats an eye if a business
            shares its revenue. It's not like that crazy for business to share their figures.<br><br>
            Now I think we have this weird time period where one person sitting in her living room can code an app and
            be making thousands of dollars a month and she's one person. That's her job, but she's also in business and
            so it's this weird mix where it can feel douchey to share your numbers but also your business. So why not?

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think you actually nailed it right there. I think the issue is how
            close I am to the project. If it were a team effort where I had two or three other people working on this,
            sharing numbers for that would feel a little bit more, well, a little less douchey, let's just say
            that.<br><br>
            But by me actually being so close to the project, it being a solo project, me sharing how much it's making
            is effectively like sharing how much I'm making. And that is when it starts to feel a bit too douchey. I
            think you nailed it right there. It's just that there's not enough separation between the two and so they
            fuse together.</p>

            opinions as well about separating your work life from your personal life. And I think that's something that
            everybody treats in a different way. I know I certainly treat it differently than you. So we'll talk about
            contextualizing your business.<br><br>
            But first, let's talk about some of your earlier projects. In 2012 you started a website called HTML5 Up.
            What's the story behind how you got started with that and how you came up with the idea?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Quite honestly for years I had worked on other stuff. I started making
            good money off of it. And then what happens when you get to a certain point, at least the way I was, you
            start getting complacent. You start not working on things as often as you should, and you inevitably just
            start sucking at what you do.<br><br>
            Because you're not keeping up. Because why should you? You're making good money, why bother? But then
            inevitably you hit a peak and then things start to decline and then you wonder, how do I get back into this?
            So 2012 I realized well, I'm really far behind so I need to do something to catch up.<br><br>
            So that's when I decided, well, the thing I really need to learn is responsive design, which I had zero
            experience with despite it being around for at least like a couple of years at that point, I think. So I
            figured, why not just jump right into it, just see what I can make and just put it out there. And if people
            think it sucks, it sucks.<br><br>
            If not, whatever. It's a good way to get public feedback on something entirely new that I have no idea what
            I'm doing with. But I figured that would be the fastest way for me to learn. So I pretty much started with,
            actually, if you go to HTML5 <a href="http://up.net" class="linkified" target="_blank">Up.net</a> right now,
            scroll to the very bottom. That template is the very first responsive design I've ever done.<br><br>
            So yes, it looks incredibly dated, but it got me going. So over the coming months I started working on it
            more, started adding better templates, learning new things and it just, man, it just grew from there. I've
            been more or less keeping up with it ever since.</p>

            era. There was a rising tide of themes and templates that would, if you just put up a site that put out
            templates of something or themes, you would actually make pretty good money off it.<br><br>
            I know a few other people who were doing the same thing around the same time, could probably attest to the
            same experience I had. There was just a lot of money in it and I made the mistake of thinking that would
            pretty much be the thing for a long time when it turned out to just be a very quick blip.</p>

            this thing is. Part of that license requires attribution. The attribution I chose is you need to just keep a
            little link or credit to HTML5 Up in the footer and that actually had a very good effect of just getting

            Some of these templates have been downloaded 418,000 times 547,000 times. How did you make this website so
            popular? There's a sea of other HTML5 template websites out there. Why are so many people downloading your

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If I go back and it's one of those things where I can say, “Well,
            clearly, I did it this way to have this effect, but quite honestly, I didn't plan for it to get this big.
            Even Pixelarity, that only came about later because I saw there was a demand for it, but it wasn't something
            I really had planned out in a premeditated way.<br><br>
            I'm going to build this, and I know how to get all my traffic and all that. If there's one theme for my
            experience with a lot of this stuff is that I've just fallen into things. I think there's something to be
            said about making yourself available to have things like that happen to you.<br><br>
            So in the case of HTML5 Up, I didn't overthink it. I was like, “Well, I'm going to put out some templates
            with a pretty permissive license. I'm not going to put a bunch of marketing bullshit all over the site. I'm
            just gonna keep it really simple, keep it a little bit more personal this time. Maybe people like that
            better,” and then it just went from there.<br><br>
            So I don't want to make it sound like it was a calculated decision because it certainly wasn't. It was just,
            I'm not going to think too much about it this time and see where things go.</p>

            is exactly what Pixelarity ended up being. It gave people attribution or credit for usage of all the HTML5
            Up stuff, gave them support.<br><br>
            And then it even gave them like extra templates that are exclusive to the service. So that was an example of
            a thing that just came out of nowhere, but I didn't plan for, but I took advantage of it. I just built
            something around it, and it worked out pretty well.</p>

            probably just use the same domain name, the same name and just add some pricing to that existing website.
            You created an entirely different brand, an entirely different website. What led you to that decision?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think because HTML5 Up seemed like it was just doing well as it was.
            You mentioned in the intro like if you search for it, it's still pretty high up in the rankings and part of
            me was like, “Well, I don't really want to mess with this too much if it's working.” The whole experience
            was working pretty well, I suppose.<br><br>
            Again, it was one of those things where I just fell into it. I didn't put a whole bunch of marketing speak
            on there. I didn't have a lot of commercial stuff. There are no ads on it with the exception of the
            Pixelarity little banner at the bottom. I just felt like I should leave it as is, build this thing as
            something separate so I don't pollute the original thing that was doing so well.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Honestly, I can't really remember. It just felt like the right price at
            the right time. So to speak back to what we were talking about before, about sharing numbers, part of it is
            when you are pricing something, a product that you're basically running on your own, you're looking at,
            “Well how much do I want to make out of this per day, per month, per year,” or whatever.<br><br>
            So if you're the only person working on it, you don't have other concerns like other teammates you have to
            pay for, whatnot. You can be pretty lenient on pricing. You can pretty much price it wherever you want,
            whatever feels fair to you. You don't have to add a whole lot more on top of it to pay for other employees
            or other liabilities you may have come with running it.</p>

            any of this up through 2016 were there any big milestones you hit? Were there any things that you'd changed
            to spur growth or was it a success right from the beginning?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Pretty much it was a success right from the beginning. It grew on its

            or something made it to where it started ranking highly, very quickly. I literally don't do SEO, that’s not
            a thing I do. I don't even really watch traffic anymore.<br><br>
            It's just right place, right time, I guess. Which I guess is completely useless to your listeners because
            I'm sure they're trying to figure out, “Well, how do I replicate something like that?” And I don't know what

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That summarizes it just better than I could. The intent behind their

            get the best possible results, then skip all the SEO ground game that you have to deal with now. Just go
            right to the end. Just say, “Well, I'm just gonna make as good of a website as I possibly can. It doesn't
            matter how they changed their algorithms,” as long as you've done that, that's the goal they're heading

            stuff, which some people still do, but back then it was what you did.<br><br>
            I made a reasonable amount of money off that. So I ended up saving most of it, which was, turns out, a
            really good idea. And by having that foundation behind me, I didn't have to really fret too much about

            millionaire or anything like that, and everything was taken care of. But when you don't have to worry so
            much about whatever you're building next, making a shitload of money right away, you can take it a bit

            that you can pay your own way to work on whatever it is that you want and you can move at your own pace

            One of the things that I'm always interested in is how founders get feedback from their peers and how we

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Mostly Twitter, I think. And especially in recent years, it's amazing
            how it doesn't matter where you are now. If you can get on Twitter and then I guess connect with the group
            of people who are doing the same thing you are, you can very easily learn what you need to learn from them.
            Get feedback.<br><br>
            In the early days of Carrd, I think my – the very first Alpha I did, it was just all people I knew on
            Twitter and maybe like a couple of people I knew in real life who were just friends. That was a huge thing
            for me, and I can't stress enough how much value I got out of Twitter over the last 10 or so years I've been
            on it.</p>

            directly.<br><br>
            So putting out my Twitter handle, opening up my DMs and just saying, “Hey, hit me on Twitter over DM or just

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Getting a tweet or a DM where someone's like, “Oh shit, this isn't
            working. What can I do?” And me just replying, basically. It almost sounds like a cliché, but people really
            do respond well to support that treats them like a human, and it sounds like it's coming from a human as
            well.<br><br>
            So that's pretty much how I handle it. Just if a person came up to me in real life and is like, “Hey, I'm
            having trouble with this thing,” then I would respond as a person would in real life. So I figured just
            translate that to the online experience as well.</p>

            Let me get you to the right,” that robotic speech, a scripted experience versus what you just described

            when clearly it's not entirely their fault that this is happening.”<br><br>
            So things deescalate very quickly. And in the case of a solo founder or a small team running a product, you
            can oftentimes get things fixed very quickly because you have access to everything.</p>

            You've got this giant change log tweet for Carrd where you make a new tweet announcing whenever you've made

            things helps me move in the right direction. And so it created this feedback loop where I just kept doing it

            That's actually pretty good. And I should mention that I think you're a lot braver than I am. I don't like

            nobody knows who you are and nobody knows that you look like, does that make it easier for you to share what

            that part of my life being criticized versus the whole thing, which I think if you're putting out your

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Why start any new project? You want to challenge yourself. And that was
            especially true in my case because I had just come off a few years of doing fuck all, really. HTMLL5 and
            Pixelarity and then Carrd, to me it's not – there wasn't a break between those because like I said, the
            years prior to that I had just wasted.<br><br>
            There was a lot of momentum pushing me to go to the next thing as soon as possible. And so I actually, I
            think I touched on this in my little “Making of” thing that I wrote up a couple of years ago, but I needed
            something that took all of the skills I had learned building what ended up being a pretty diverse array of
            templates that had a lot of pretty crazy features, in my view.<br><br>
            I needed something that would take all of that and challenge me in an entire product that took advantage of
            all of these things. Front end, back end, weird user interface stuff I learned along the way. I had a few
            ideas that weren't Carrd that just seemed not really my thing. And Carrd, that idea came from just thinking,
            “Well, what am I already familiar with?”<br><br>
            And that was clearly had a lot of experience doing website design, site templates, that sort of thing. So it
            felt like the best first choice for any project. Now I didn't anticipate it turning into effectively a
            full-time gig like it is now. But then again, who does?</p>

            much any solution because everyone going to need a website that's a little bit different from the next
            person.<br><br>
            The features they need a different, what they're willing to pay will be different. So, you could really
            carve out a niche within this much larger market and not really step on anyone else's toes. You will to an
            extent, but you can coexist with a Squarespace, a Wix, all these other guys.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think being willing to take risks and being willing to try to do
            things your own way, which is a point I try to drive home quite a bit is that, you're going to fail if you
            try to copy one of the big guys because the reason why that they're able to do what they do is because
            they're a much larger operation than you are.<br><br>
            You've got to think of some way to get into that market that takes advantage of what you have, which is a
            much smaller size, so you don't have quite as much overhead as they do, but also you're not as big as they
            are, so you can focus on perhaps one small niche of what they can do, but you can do better.<br><br>
            So in my case, it was the one-page site type, which all these other guys do, too, but those services are
            actually built more for full on websites. So they're not going to be as into it or as detailed about how
            they go about it than I would be.</p>

            early stage of your company. They stick with you for years. How else did you want to differentiate Carrd

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, I touched on it a little bit, but constraints just are something
            that comes with doing a project like that yourself. It's just you, you don't have 30 developers. You can
            say, “Hey, we're going to cover all of this ground.” You have to actually look at what ground is out there
            to cover and then say, “Well, what can I do myself that is not going to kill me because it's just me doing
            this.”<br><br>
            So I think by having your set of constraints from the get-go, it makes you get creative with what your
            product ends up looking like. So in my case it was, well, I'm going to be doing all of it. What does all of
            it look like for me? Well, clearly, I can only go after maybe one or two niches, probably just one quite
            honestly, because you can't spread yourself that thin.<br><br>
            It has to be simple enough to where it's not gonna have a huge amount of support overhead, just lots of
            little decisions like that. And then you end up landing on a very small sliver of this otherwise gigantic
            market. And I think just your constraints end up defining that and then you can go from there.</p>

            part, what I saw as one of the most popular things on HTML5 Up was the one-page templates. So clearly there
            was something there.<br><br>
            Like the numbers on the download button that you were just talking about earlier. They're really high for
            one-page designs and I, up until that point, did not know that was really a thing. I just did those on a
            whim. So the validation to an extent came from just seeing that and saying, “Oh shit, a lot of people
            downloading these, maybe there's something there.”</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So I had to first figure out, do I have the skill set to build
            something like this? Because even though I had worked on so many templates and some other projects along the
            way, I didn't know if I had it in me to really pull together all of those things into one single product
            that needed all of it.<br><br>
            So the first thing I did was build a very rough prototype of what would later be called the generator part
            of Carrd, which would take the raw data from a user to build a site and then actually generate the HTML, the
            CSS and whatnot. That was really the first foray into building this thing to see if I could even do that. I
            did.<br><br>
            And so then I ended up just iterating on that, building every other layer outside it until basically I had a
            full working product.</p>

            in front of you.<br><br>
            So for example, a lot of people talk about launching your startup. Well, if you start to think of your
            startup as something that's analogous to rocket launches, you're probably going to spend all of your time
            building and tinkering upfront and you're going to invest all of your marketing effort into this one single
            moment in time and then expect it to carry itself from there.</p>

            is that of inventions. So if you think of your startup as analogous to inventing something and you're
            probably going to put a whole lot of weight behind the idea and building it, you're probably going to keep
            your idea secret and I want to tell anybody and you're going to undervalue the subsequent execution, finding
            users, etc. I'm curious what analogies you use, AJ. How do you envision the whole journey of a startup in

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Huh. I actually kept a lid on it for at least the first, six months
            until I did the alpha. It didn't even have a name. I only emailed less than a dozen people about it. I
            avoided talking about it on Twitter. I think I may have teased one or two things along the way, but I don't
            know.<br><br>
            I would hesitate to call it an invention because it's not really anything that revolutionary or innovative
            in that regard. But I think part of it was, and this goes a little bit back to when you're building in
            public to an extent, you're a little bit nervous to share too much about something before it is really
            viable.<br><br>
            Is this thing going to suck? If it is, I don't really want to share where I'm at 10%. I'd rather just keep a
            lid on it until it feels like it's time to start telling people about it.</p>

            more.<br><br>
            I have a bit more formal of a roadmap now, but to an extent there is still just winging it. If something
            comes up out of nowhere that I didn't anticipate, but it seems like it would be a good thing to add and it

            There's also still value in being flexible enough to incorporate new things out of nowhere. One of Carrd's
            biggest features is the custom form, payment enabled form thing.<br><br>
            Which, literally, I had no plans for. And it came out of a conversation with Pieter Levels just on a whim.
            Right after I was like, “Shit, I'm going to do this.” And so, immediately I started working on it. I don't

            because that's who I emailed. I think around early 2016 is when I started announcing publicly on Twitter
            that I have a new thing. I'm doing an open beta. So if you're interested in trying it out, DM me or email me
            and I'll give you the details.<br><br>
            And so I probably got a few dozen more that way because I didn't really publicly share a lot of information
            about what this thing was until people reached out to me. At that time I still wanted to keep a lid on it
            for whatever reason.<br><br>
            After launching, it's been a while since I looked at this, but probably I started getting a decent number of
            new users from just that on Twitter and then the Product Hunt launch just blasted of the crap out of all of
            that because that's what Product Hunt tends to do. It certainly nowhere near what I'm getting today but it
            was pretty good just on Twitter alone.</p>

            I felt like I had leveled up a lot during the development process. If it didn't go well or if it just

            commercially viable product at the very least it's a very cool like portfolio piece.” If I need to get
            another gig or something, I can just point to that and say, “Hey, I built this on my own.” So it would have

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The business model hasn't changed a whole lot, but I did make one very
            good decision early on and that was to first make it a free product because I know there's a lot of debate
            as to whether you should go freemium or not.<br><br>
            And I think for something like Carrd, I felt that either I invest a whole lot in marketing and demo videos
            and all kinds of shit just to show people what the product can do. Or fuck it, I'll just let people use it
            for free and then make it to where the really cool stuff is behind is paywall. So it launched with the free
            plan that anyone can get just by going to the website.<br><br>
            Then a pro plan, which was 19 bucks a year that gave you custom domains, forms, and I think, honestly not a
            ton more beyond that when it first launched. I added a bunch more to it later, but not – I think only
            launched with those two key features.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That's a good combination to launch with free and paid plans. Most of
            the founders I talked to who are doing things that are free, it's really because they're afraid to charge.
            So they launch and day one they've got a free plan, but there is no, there's no paid plan and they say, “Oh,
            yeah, one day I'll get to it as long as I can make my free users happy.” How did you decide to launch with
            your paid plan?</p>

            users and attention, really. For it to only have a free plan I felt like I would be missing out on some
            potential conversions.<br><br>
            And also that's a good way to get a sense of, “Is this a good product beyond it just being free? Would
            people actually want to pay for it?” And so by launching with both at the same time, I was able to validate
            that very quickly. And in my case, it was, “Oh yeah, people are willing to pay for this thing.” So that's,
            that is really great and extremely motivating, quite honestly.</p>

            your product for free. For Carrd you have tens of thousands of people signing up every month who never
            convert to paying users.<br><br>
            I tell people not to build products for consumers, target businesses instead, but the vast majority of your
            customers are just regular people. Not that it seems to matter, you're killing it anyway. In your opinion,

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I would say your advice is good generally speaking. And I have to
            stress that Carrd is a special case just as every product is. You can't look at Carrd and say, “Well this is
            the way to do it.” I'm only sharing my personal experiences with this stuff and that's all I can really
            speak to. So what works for me is not necessarily gonna work for anyone listening.<br><br>
            That being said, I think being dogmatic about how to do things is a good way to box yourself in and not take
            different approaches or even just risks that may end up panning out. So in the case of Carrd for instance,
            there's an aspect to it that I would say, yeah, I winged it. I certainly winged it.<br><br>
            I probably could have done things a little bit different, but it ended up panning out because I was willing
            to just take those risks going in and not be held back by, “Well, all the startup advice I've seen tells me
            to do otherwise.”</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So let's dive into some of the specific ways that Carrd is unique. The
            first thing we already touched on is pricing. You have pricing plans that go as low as $9 a year. What is it
            about Carrd that makes this a good decision?</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, Carrd initially launched with that single $19 a year plan because
            that felt like a good starting point. But as time went on, it became clear that there are just so many
            different types of people using it and I figured it being a freemium product, I should come up with a way to
            incentivize converting those free users over to paid.<br><br>
            That's obvious. So in the case of that $9 a year plan, I noticed about, it's been maybe like a year and a
            half, maybe two years even a certain demographic of users began using Carrd as you well know. Kpop
            aficionados among others. And again, a use case I didn't anticipate, but still pretty cool. Those users
            would probably never pay for the features on a regular pro plan because those features are more business
            oriented, custom domain forms, Google analytics, that type of stuff.<br><br>
            So I needed a plan that had features that they would actually want to pay for and also price it in such a
            way that they would almost on a whim upgrade to that plan because it's so cheap. Because I figured, look,
            it's either a decision between that – getting something out of them or getting nothing out of them.<br><br>
            So by adding this plan, I actually ended up converting quite a few of them. Maybe not all, it’s not a huge
            percentage, but at least now I'm actually converting some of those users who would have otherwise just been
            free users.</p>

            thing is gonna do well, which I guess it's hard to really – that advice doesn't always apply because it have
            very well not gone well. But I would have made some better code decisions.<br><br>
            It's not to say what I have right now is not – I can't work with, it's certainly, it's fine, but there are
            aspects to it, where had I seen where things were going way back when I started, I probably would have
            structured things just a little bit differently to make my life a bit easier now. That's not that big of a
            deal.<br><br>
            Beyond that I'd say, maybe – actually I can't really think of anything else. I'm not saying that I got
            everything perfect. It’s almost as if I just lucked into the right setup to handle the scale that I have
            now. That could very well change in a few years, maybe even sooner. But as it stands right now, I think
            between my own good decisions and just straight up luck, there's not a whole lot that needs to have been
            changed.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I would say, first it being free because the barriers to entry is
            pretty much eliminated at that point. People aren't having to hand over a credit card to use it. The second
            thing would be, and actually this was a conscious decision, the process to get into building the site, like
            to try out Carrd, if you've never used it before and you just want to give it a go, you literally just click
            a button.<br><br>
            You don't have to give an email, you don't have to do anything. You just click the, well actually I think
            you have do two clicks. You click the button, then you choose a template you want, and you just go right
            into it. No sign up required. That turned out to be a hugely beneficial decision.
            Especially going back to the Product Hunt launch.<br><br>
            That became extremely effective because of this one decision I made where people like the, there's like no
            reason where you can't just accidentally build a website with Carrd because you were just clicking
            around.<br><br>
            You'll end up building something, you don't have to type anything. So that was probably a big part of it.
            And I think just I really deliberately tried to keep Carrd’s copy, marketing, whatever you want to call it,
            as not marketing-ish at all, if that makes sense.</p>

            do it, I think people are more capable of doing things that they give themselves credit for. And I think of
            that comes from just this desire to pigeonhole yourself. You want to give yourself a label like, “Well, I'm
            a developer.” So if you see any problem that requires even a modicum of design effort, you're just like,
            “Well that's not my thing. I'm a developer.”<br><br>
            And I think it's like, well maybe actually you may be okay at design, you may be good enough at design to
            actually solve that problem. So why don't I give it a go? That doesn't mean become a designer and all this,
            but just try it. And the same goes for designers. You're human, you're smart you can solve problems. There's
            no reason you can't apply that aspect of it to solving maybe a backend development problem.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">You pretty much summed it up right there. They are just pleased with
            what they can make with very little effort and I think that is what spreads it. Carrd is a unique case for
            many reasons and I think that's one aspect is that you're creating something visual. It's very easy to
            spread something like that because you can make something and say, “Hey, I made this thing,” and then
            someone can look at it and immediately say, “Oh wow, that looks cool. I want to make a thing like that
            too.”<br><br>
            For other products that are a bit more technically oriented or – okay, Air Table. Air Table is freaking
            amazing, but it's a little bit hard to spread it virally in the same way that Carrd can go because you're
            showing basically what's a spreadsheet to someone. That's not as – unless that person already has a need for
            something like that or familiarity, they are going to be like, “I'm looking at a spreadsheet.”</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">You're right. There's just something about what it is that you're
            building. It's a website. If you build a website, the point of it is to show other people. Probably very few
            people build a website just for themselves and so it's like making a greeting card company or
            something.<br><br>
            If you're selling greeting cards, you can be pretty sure that your customers are going to share the card
            with someone else because that's what you do with greeting cards. Do you do anything on top of that? Do you
            have any incentives? Like, “Hey, invite a friend and we'll give you $5 off,” or something like that?</p>

            just made there, that's definitely been suggested by other people that I should do something like that. At
            the very least like a referral or affiliate program or something. Definitely good ideas. It's just I haven't
            really had a need to do that just yet.<br><br>
            I'm not dismissing it, like, “Oh I'm growing so well I don't need that.” It's growing pretty well on its
            own. That's given me a lot of free time to work on the product itself. So to go back to how I spend no time
            on marketing. Well, by not spending any time on marketing, guess what I can spend that time on? Actual
            features for the product and enhance it that way.<br><br>
            Courtland Allen [00:56:41 ] Let's talk about that because a lot of us are building products and especially
            in your case where you've got so many users, so many people giving you suggestions and so much surface area
            because what you're building is so general, I bet you've got a feature list of like 1,000,001 ideas for
            things you can build with Carrd.<br><br>
            How do you decide what to work on next? And you consider yourself more of a long-term planner or a strategic
            prioritizer or how do you figure this all out?</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So short term stuff. Again, a lot of people who have suggestions to
            make small enhancements to things and when those come in, I'll look at it and think, “Well, is this – how
            much time am I gonna end up spending on implementing it?” It has to pass the filter. Is this a good idea for
            Carrd or not?<br><br>
            If it is, I look at it and think, “Well, is this something that will take a few minutes, implement a few
            hours, a few days, or a few weeks?” More often than not, the stuff that just takes a few minutes where a few
            hours will be prioritized because especially if more than one person suggested this, clearly there's – if
            two completely different people in a short amount of time suggest the same thing and it's a relatively small
            feature to add, then it makes sense to go ahead and add it because they're probably people who are looking
            for that but don't think to ask for it.<br><br>
            So I'll prioritize those things. Other things though, beyond that more major stuff, I ended up putting into
            a just a general – I have a text file just full of major ideas and those are things that I'm not quite sure
            at what point I'm going to work on them, but they were good enough ideas to where I know at some point those
            need to make it into the product in some form or fashion.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Interestingly, this goes back to the way I handle support for even a
            HTML5 Up and Pixelarity. I guess by keeping that communication channel open and making sure people knew,
            “Yeah, you're talking to the person who made this thing.”<br><br>
            It makes it easier for them, even as they're asking, requesting support or something to just get in touch
            when they're like, “Hey, I have this idea for this thing,” they're not having to go through many levels of
            bureaucracy to get to me. They just shoot me an email and there it is. So I don't really have to go out and
            really seek input. I get a lot of feedback just from people getting in touch with me every day.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">One of the things that I struggle with Indie Hackers is that I have
            this platform that I'm creating and there's this, I don't know how to describe it. Maybe it's a fine line
            you walk between being prescriptive about what features to build into your product and also keeping things
            open-ended so that users can surprise you.<br><br>
            That's something that you deal with Carrd as well. You have all sorts of people building cool websites that
            you never would have imagined, but at the same time you're coding up a very limited set of tools that they
            have at their disposal to create these websites with.<br><br>
            How do you think about enabling your users to be creative and do whatever it is that they want while also
            making sure that the sites that they create fit in with your goals and your design aesthetic and what you
            think they need to be doing?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">And that's an excellent question because there is always that
            possibility where if you were too open and you just go with what your users want, you'll end up with this
            crazy mess of – it would be an incoherent mess of features that don't really fit together. You'll have niche
            features for very specific people who will never – don't really have general usage beyond that specific
            niche.<br><br>
            It's a great question because the way I handle it is anytime a someone requests a feature, I'll always look
            at it in the context of, “That's great. How does this fit into the overall picture of what Carrd is and will
            other people beyond just this particular person’s use case actually get use out of it?”<br><br>
            And if it doesn't pass that test, then more often than not I won't come back to it just because I don't want
            to start adding on hyper specific features for hyper specific niches because that's just going to clutter
            the product and make it less usable overall.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's fascinating because I had Des Traynor, the chief strategist for
            Intercom on the podcast on last year. I asked him how they prioritize features at Intercom.They have this
            whole framework called RICE. It stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort. And it sounds like you are
            a pretty much doing that exact same thing without having a fancy name for it.<br><br>
            You think about E, the effort part of it, you're prioritizing things that are much quicker to do versus
            doing things that take a long time to do. So you get a lot more features out the door. Or the reach. You're
            consciously thinking about how many of my users will actually use this feature. I don't want to build
            something that only 5% or 10% of people are going to experience. And all of this sounds obvious in
            hindsight, but your intuition often as a founder is not to do either one of these things.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That is really interesting that like there's a formal term they have
            for it because that does sound exactly what I'm doing. A good part of it is intuition. I think overthinking
            this stuff in advance, I think you'll end up missing the boat to an extent. If you just dive into it and you
            start working on the product and you start interacting with your customers, a lot of this stuff will just
            become apparent as you go.<br><br>
            I realized that right off the bat when I started getting people requesting features that are like, “This
            would basically require me to rewrite the entire product in a different way. I'm not doing that.” I didn't
            run it through that acronym.<br><br>
            I just basically thought, “Well, no, there's no way I'm doing that. I only have so many hours in the day
            where I can work on this thing. I'm not doing that.” But then I'll get someone email me a little bit later
            saying, “Hey, do you think you could add this tiny little thing?” And I'm like, “Well, that makes a lot of
            sense. I'm going to go ahead and do that right now.” Purely intuition, and I think everyone has this, once
            they put themselves in that situation.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I'd say the biggest thing when you're dealing with a consumer-oriented
            product – and I didn't expect Carrd to be this way, but it is what it is. You have a lot of user content and
            you've got to basically moderate that stuff because who knows what crazy shit may end up on there. Luckily,
            we really haven't had anything really untoward be put up on the platform.<br><br>
            But man, content moderation is definitely a thing you have to deal with when you're dealing with a platform
            like this. And I think if I had – to go back to the previous question, you asked if there's anything I could
            have told myself back when I first started, I would have told myself, “Be ready for this and maybe have a
            system in place where right away that you can use as opposed to something that you have to very quickly
            implement and iterate on in a short amount of time to get up to speed.”<br><br>
            Which is pretty much what happened when Carrd launched on Product Hunt. Up until then I was getting maybe a
            dozen new site today at most and then it got on Product Hunt and it was up in the hundreds. That's like a
            shit ton more content and nothing shady ended up on there.<br><br>
            But I was like, well I can see where this could go, though, with this many people adding sites. Someone's
            going to have to look at these and make sure people aren't posting porn or something, which we don't allow
            on the platform. How are we going to do that? And for a while there, I didn't have a good solution in place
            because I just didn't really think of that. As part of growing pains, I guess, with a platform like this,
            you just don't know what you're going to get with user content.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Part of it is automation and that's the thing that I implemented over
            the last nine months that's really made a huge positive impact on it. And also having an interface in there
            for manual moderation as well for stuff that the automated systems just can't figure out on its own.<br><br>
            So my business partner, who I'm working with on other stuff before, used to not really be involved in Carrd,
            but then when moderation became something I couldn't handle on my own, he had to come in and start handling
            it.<br><br>
            With his feedback I built a good interface where he can quickly go through what sites are remaining in the
            moderation queue that the automation couldn't take care of itself. So I wouldn't say that's something that
            went bad. It was definitely something that could have been better early on, though.</p>

            in to do the moderation angle. When I was doing that myself and then also working on the product, I started
            spending like a couple of hours a day doing moderation. I was like, “No, fuck this. I'm not doing this.” So
            I handed it off to him.<br><br>
            He took care of it for a while, but then it started getting even beyond the couple of hour range to three,
            four hours. And at that point it was like, “Alright, we need a solution that scales.” Well then, to answer
            the second part of that question, how do I scale up with it? Well, a huge part of it is automation because
            you'll find in even a product like Carrd, there are lots of little things that early on you do manually just
            out of habit, you don't even think about it.<br><br>
            But then as things grow and you get more users and more content, you start seeing the repetitive things you
            end up doing every day that just take up time that could otherwise be, in many cases, automated. Scaling
            automation is 100% key, especially if it's just you working on this thing. Or even in my case where I have a
            business partner handling content moderation.<br><br>
            I don't want him spending 18 hours a day moderating content because that's just not cool. So automation even
            helps if you have more than one person working on something and that can take you really far.</p>

            contractors in the past?</p>

            At that point where I'm hiring people to do stuff, I know I've done my absolute best to automate whatever I
            could before I try to go the route of spending money on people, if that makes sense.</p>

            You're making close to $30,000 a month. How have your goals and your vision changed for what you want this

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">The adventure every day of just seeing where the product goes, which I
            touched on a little bit before. Every day people are just using it in different ways. I don't know,
            something cool about when you make something, and then other people are using it and getting value out of
            it. There are people using Carrd now at an agency level where they're building websites for clients.<br><br>
            And I was like, “I never expected people to use it that way, but it's so awesome that they're using Carrd to
            power part of their business so they can move forward.” And that's just really cool to me. So things like
            that really keep me going on the project. And as far as where I see it going though, there's so many like
            major features. I mentioned that text file I have where I have major things written down that I'm not sure
            when I'll get to it, but I'd like to get to it.<br><br>
            One of the big things right now that I'm thinking about is taking a whack at commerce and seeing how I can
            do that in a Carrd way. Who knows what they'll end up looking like, but it sounds like just a natural
            challenge to add even more value to platform, but also just more value that users can get out of it.</p>

            a nice lifestyle for the founders, the employees and the customers. What is the point of Carrd for you?

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Part of that, I think, is dictated by how you start. If you're taking
            funding, I think that dictates the terms of how you run the product. So if you're taking funding, you have
            an incentive to get your revenue going, grow as quickly as possible. If you're doing it yourself and you're
            self-funding it, you have a little bit more freedom in that.<br><br>
            And so you can take it slowly. You can choose not to grow. You grow it at a manageable pace, like what I'm
            doing. You have more options available to you. For me, though, right now Carrd is more of just a thing that
            I do. It's gotten to where it is my full-time job, which I didn't anticipate even two years ago when it was
            still at that side project phase. I'm enjoying it and I'm going to keep doing it as long as people want to
            use it and as long as I still have ideas I can put into it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If you're just starting out, if you haven't even figured out what you

            you. It doesn't have to be a world changing product or something that's going to sell for billions of
            dollars.<br><br>
            Just find something in your life that interests you and then build a small product around it that solves a
            problem or make something better or whatever. As long as it's fun and keeps you interested. I think that's
            always the best way to start because especially if you've never done it before, that gives you the
            motivation to move to the next level because then you realize, “Wow, I can do this. This is something that
            I'm capable of doing.”</p>

                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com/review</a> and that should open up iTunes on your
            computer. I read pretty much all the reviews that you guys leave over there, and it really helps other
            people to discover the show, so your support is very much appreciated.<br><br>
            In addition, if you are running your own internet business or if that’s something you hope to do someday,
            you should join me and a whole bunch of other founders on the <a href="http://indiehackers.com"

            pretty much any problem or question that you might have while running your business.<br><br>
            If you listen to the show, you know that I am a huge proponent of getting help from other founders rather
            than trying to build your business all by yourself. So you’ll see me on the forum for sure as well as more
