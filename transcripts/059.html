            listening to the Indie Hackers Podcast. On this show I talk to the founders of profitable internet
            businesses and I try to get a sense of what it’s like to be in their shoes. How did they get to where they
            are today, how do they make decisions both at their companies and in their personal lives, and what exactly
            makes their business tick? And the goal here, as always, is so that the rest of us can go on to build our
            own successful companies.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Today I’m talking to John Doherty, the founder of a company called Credo, which is an online marketplace
            which has generated many millions of dollars’ worth of marketing work for SEO experts and other marketers as
            well.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So John, welcome to the show and thanks so much for joining me.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I thought the conference was awesome. The content was solid, the
            speakers were really, really good. But I would say that the thing that I took away from that the most was
            just that it’s one of the most valuable conferences I’ve been to in terms of just the quality of people that
            are there. Everyone there is smart, interesting. There’s no one that’s just kind of putting in their time at
            a company and looking to grow a little bit. Everyone is working really hard and creative and trying to build
            something of value. So I thought it was absolutely incredible.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. This was my second year going to MicroConf, and I feel the same
            way. They’ve done an incredible job bringing in the right kinds of people who are serious about building a
            business or learning how to build a business, or in many cases, already are building a business.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And I think meetups, and to a lesser degree conferences, have a reputation for attracting people who aren’t
            really that serious, who just want to come to mingle, but don’t want to really go anywhere with it. So hats
            off to Mike and Rob and everybody involved for running a conference that really attracts very high-quality
            people.</p>

            and then they also had starter for a couple days after growth finished, where that was everyone looking to
            get started.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I think that split it up nicely that the growth track – we could focus on growing a business and people
            talking about going from 20k to 80k a month – it’s like the guys from FOMO talked about – is super valuable
            there, versus someone that doesn’t have any revenue coming in. That’s not really going to gel for them. So

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So basically, Credo currently is a – the best way to describe it is a
            lead-generation service for digital marketing agencies and consultants. So what we do is help businesses
            that are looking to hire an agency or a consultant to do SEO, content marketing, link building, Facebook
            ads, AdWords, those sorts of things – help them to get connected up with the right agencies, continue those
            conversations, and then hopefully, ultimately, hire someone to help them grow their business.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I started this business five and a half years ago, which is crazy, beginning of 2013, because I saw a need.
            And then it kind of ticked along as a side project for a number of years, for a couple years, two and a half
            years, and then I started working on it full time end of September of 2015. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And it’s been through a bunch of iterations. I’ve been through three or four different business models, and
            it was a fully automated marketplace at one point. I realized that didn’t work and went back to a higher
            touch model. And I’ve kind of been through a lot with it, but it’s a good business, I think it fits a need
            in the digital-marketing industry, and it’s afforded me a good lifestyle. So I have no complaints.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Managing a business that is doing – so in 2017, my business did about 350k in revenue across the
            lead-generation business and consulting. And managing that size of business – that was over double from the
            previous year, and it is so much more work to manage a business of that size as well. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You have to automate a lot of things, you have to rely on a lot of people, and make the decisions about what
            to invest in, who to hire, what services to pay for. For example, I pay for bookkeepers and accountants and
            that sort of thing so that I can actually focus on growing the business. All of those decisions become a lot
            harder as you grow, but at the same time, they’re growth problems and they’re good problems to have.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, those are great problems to have. So let’s talk about how you’ve
            actually gotten to where you are. Because from what I understand, Credo is the first business you’ve
            started, which is pretty unusual for the people that I talk to on the show.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What are some of the more influential life events that led you to this point?</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">So as you said, Credo is my first business that has ever made any
            revenue, it’s the first business entity I ever formed. I’ve had side projects and such and sold consulting
            before, and Credo actually came out of me stopping doing my own consulting back at the end of 2012.
            Obviously, I do my own now still.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So what got me to this point is – so I was trained as a web developer in college. I went to James Madison
            University in Virginia, where I’m from. And had an internship as a web developer at a software company in
            the Northern Virginia area summer 2007, so we’re going back a decade now, which makes me feel old.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I was trained as a frontend web developer, and then was basically helping to run a company from Switzerland
            for about a year, where we were selling English-language books, but we were based in French-speaking
            Switzerland in a bootstrapped company, myself and the founder. And basically, I had to learn how to market
            things online.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And so SEO just made sense, and so I basically started learning SEO and was blogging. We now call it
            “content marketing.” And it just kind of came to me. It just kind of made a lot of sense to me and kind of
            how my brain is put together.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Over the course of my career, I helped to run that company, though I wasn’t the founder and I was probably
            too inexperienced to really be doing it. And I’ve worked agency side. I worked for a couple different
            agencies and worked in-house for a couple of years as well, running SEO marketing and growth on a couple of
            Zillow’s sub-brands.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I’ve built teams, I’ve grown teams, I’ve managed people, I started stuff on my own, done my own
            consulting. I am (inaudible) enough as a web developer. I built most of the Credo platform with myself with
            some help from some freelance developers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I think one of the biggest things that I’ve done over the course of my career is to kind of be a jack of
            all trades and know a little bit about a lot of things and know a lot about a couple of things.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I don’t know that I’ve really thought about it that deeply, to be
            totally honest with you. I was always kind of a little bit of a lazy student. I come from a family of
            educators. My father worked in higher education for about 30 years, and my mom is an elementary school
            teacher. And I was homeschooled until high school as well, so I didn’t really apply myself a ton in high
            school, didn’t really have specific things that I really enjoyed.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Ended up graduating top 10% in my class. I know I could have done better if I had worked harder. I could
            have gotten a better SAT score if I had studied harder, but I basically just figured, “Hey, I’m doing enough
            to get by and I’m happy.” I’ve never been that person that I’m like, “I want to have a $10-million-a-year
            business, or I want to get my MBA from Stanford” or something like that. Not that there’s anything wrong
            with either of those, but I just haven’t been that type of person, super focused in that way really ever in
            my lifetime.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I like learning, I like reading, and I’ve recently tried to dial that back a little bit and practice a
            little bit more just-in-time learning and taking care of things when they need to be done as opposed to,
            “This strikes my fancy now, so I’m going to do it.” But I think part of that as well is just getting a
            little bit older and having a business that works and having customers that are relying on me and having to
            be more strategic in that way.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s fascinating to hear you talk about how you weren’t really
            motivated to try very hard at school and you didn’t really give it your all, because being a solo founder
            and being a jack of all trades really requires a substantial amount of effort. There’s no real way that you
            can just phone it in. You have to try hard in order to get to where you’ve gotten.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. I think I had to find something that I was really passionate
            about and that really drove me; not that necessarily I’m super passionate about generating leads for
            marketing agencies, but it’s something that I can do and that I can do well. And I think passion only gets
            you so far.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I’ve always had a good work ethic, but it was a matter of finding something that I wanted to really

            things like that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            All of those just weren’t really how I was put together. But once I actually commit to something – on my own
            personal website, my personal blog, I blogged twice a week every Tuesday and Thursday from the very
            beginning of 2011 until almost the end of 2013. So for about three years I published two blogposts a week.
            So I can keep at things and I can commit to things, but it has to be something that I’m really committed to
            doing.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s totally underrated how much satisfaction you can derive from just
            being good at things. I remember being a kid and spending a lot of time on the computer. And a lot of it was
            just because the adults around me were encouraging and they would say things like, “Oh, you’re really great
            at computers, keep it up.” And so I just took pride in getting that kind of feedback.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And it’s the same with running a business. If you find something that maybe isn’t the most interesting thing
            in the world, but you’re really good at it and you can take pride in being good at it, then that can keep
            you motivated when things get tough.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Totally. And I think for some of us, just having a problem to solve is
            a big driver as well. I see people up on Indie Hackers or other places launching these SaaS apps for
            scheduling social media posts. No one’s like, “Oh, you know what I’m really passionate about? Letting people
            automate their social media accounts.” No one says that. They’re like, “Hey, this is an interesting problem
            to solve, there’s a business opportunity here, and so I’m going to see what it can be.”</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And then also especially developers are really good at building new apps and making things work. And you can
            always move onto something else as well. Just because you built one tool doesn’t mean that you can’t move on
            and do other things or expand the vision of that company, and then ultimately, shut down the thing that you
            started with. There are so many different ways to go with a business.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it’s a fairly quick story. I was working inside of Zillow Group
            and I’d just moved over to a new brand. I’d been running marketing on one brand and moved over to another
            brand that they had acquired. And basically, some things moved around internally. And the team that I had
            brought over to that brand with me and myself ended up getting laid off near the end of 2015, end of
            September 2015.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I think a lot of people have been through that with acquisitions and moving into a new role and it
            doesn’t work out, and it’s part of business. It’s actually interesting that a lot of people that I’ve spoken
            with, a lot of entrepreneurs and such as well, have also been laid off and actually started working for
            themselves because they got laid off.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I think there’s something to that. Just like when I worked for an SEO agency, we found that a lot of the
            best SEOs that we hired had been former professional poker players. So think it’s the same way with
            entrepreneurs. Whenever I see a successful entrepreneur, I’m like, “When were you laid off?” And most of
            them have been.</p>

            But I started interviewing with some companies. And some called me back and had good conversations, had

            in the next four to six months, something like that. And I entertained them. And it was San Francisco and
            they were director-of-marketing jobs. It was good salary.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But basically, my gut told me, “Don’t do it. Don’t take them. You’re not going to be happy. You might stick
            around for a year, year and a half.” And I didn’t really have an interest in playing the startup lottery
            either. You never know with companies, especially if you’re not the founder, you’re not controlling the
            ultimate destiny. And if you’re kind of banking on stock being worth something someday, then it’s kind of a
            crapshoot.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I just didn’t really have the desire to do it. And I got laid off on a Monday and told some people on
            Tuesday, and by the end of that week, I had had a ton of people wanting to work with me and basically had to
            stop taking phone calls because I had so many people wanting me to consult with them. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I pretty quickly picked up a bunch of consulting work, and I didn’t have to go back and take a job. And
            so I didn’t and wanted to see what my business could be, and I always figured that I could go back and get a
            job. And I still kind of think about it that way. It’s like, “Well, if this doesn’t work out, I can start
            another company or I can just consult or I can go get a job.” So there wasn’t a, “I have to figure it out in
            the next month, otherwise I’m not going to be able to pay my bills” sort of thing. I’ve been fortunate in
            that way.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I just decided it wasn’t for me, and I wouldn’t be okay with myself if I didn’t give this a go.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, exactly. And I think that’s also the value of having a skill that
            you go deep in. We talked at the beginning about being a jack of all trades and knowing a little bit about a
            lot of things, but also having some things that I know a whole lot about; so for example, SEO. And I’ve been
            in SEO for almost a decade now, which is a lot of time and it’s constantly changing, and I’m not passionate.
            As we were talking about earlier, I’m not passionate about it like I once was, and that’s okay. But I’m good
            at it and I can provide a lot of value to companies doing it. And sometimes that’s all you need.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">What are some of the lessons that you’ve learned from doing your

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it is. And for a little bit, the first three to four months after
            I got laid off, I was basically consulting full time, and then evenings and such was trying to carve out
            some time for getting started on Credo and fixing the site as it was at that point. It was a different brand
            name and kind of getting it to a point where I could do a launch. And then I did that, and then I had to go
            through a rebranding.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It’s really a lot of managing your time. Getting consulting clients isn’t really a challenge for me because
            I’m fairly well-known in the SEO world and have a specific niche type of website that I work on. And so
            basically, if a website that has more than 100,000 pages, that’s a pretty good brand, that’s dealing with
            technical SEO issues and needs a seasoned consultant to come in and kind of guide them and work with their
            team to get things done, I’m their guy and I know that I can close those projects.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So the lead-gen part was never hard for me and to this point hasn’t been a challenge for me. Even now I
            still turn people away that want to work with me directly, or I put them through Credo, so it’s nice to have
            that for sure. And that’s why I started the business in its first incarnation as well five and a half years
            ago.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It’s all about time management. But one thing that I’ve learned is it’s also really hard – once your
            business gets to a certain point, once your side project – let’s say like Credo was when I first started
            working on it, when I first went out on my own a couple years ago, it was kind of a side project that was
            like, “All right, let’s see if this can get going and be a bigger part of my business’s revenue.” So it was
            all about managing time.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But at some point, the time that you put into consulting or something like that almost becomes a liability
            because you have so much to do with your other business. Because okay, it’s working quite well, but maybe
            it’s not quite profitable. And so you cut back on consulting a little bit and revenue goes up, but then it’s
            not quite up enough that you’re profitable. And so you have to pick up more consulting and then business
            slows.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So Brian Casel of Productize &amp; Scale talks about this quite a bit as well. And the way he kind of frames
            – he was at MicroConf. The way he frames it has really helped me think about it as well.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So it’s all about that time-management part there, and I pretty quickly realized I didn’t want to do just
            consulting. I could have easily done that. I could have easily started a traditional agency, and that’s just
            not the kind of business I wanted to build.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What are some of the mechanics behind how you became well-known? And is that something you fostered
            intentionally, or did it just sort of happen?</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I wouldn’t say I really fostered it intentionally. I basically set out
            to make friends, and I ended up making friends with a lot of pretty influential people in the SEO world. And
            a lot of them are still friends of mine and people that I interact on almost a daily basis, and some of them
            I’ve done business with.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And business, I would say, is all about relationships but also not going into them and being like, “I’m
            going to meet so and so that I can become a celebrity in the SEO world or in the jQuery.” That’s not what it
            is. It’s actually being an interesting and nice person and looking to provide value where you can.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I would say one of the biggest things – I mentioned that I blogged twice a week for almost three years
            on my personal site. And I literally just set out to teach everything that I know or that I was learning. So
            I gave away free tools and I wrote about different trends in the industry and wrote very specific things
            about link building and (inaudible) and what have you. This was 2011 to 2013. It was a very different kind
            of environment then in the digital-marketing world. Things have changed a lot over the last five years.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I wrote a ton and I promoted it and people started linking to me, and so my site kind of grew over time.
            And so I’ve gained just a big following on my personal site. The following is not that big anymore, but
            gained a big following on Twitter, and that enabled me to launch and kind of build Credo in its initial
            stages, get initial traction. So building an audience – I still think one of the best ways to do it is to
            teach everything that you know.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s perfect that you’ve got a blog and your skillset lies in SEO and
            marketing, because those are two of the best skills that you can use to grow a blog and build your online
            presence.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You mentioned that a lot of it comes down to teaching everything that you know, and I think a blog is great
            for that as well because it’s going to be frequented by people who don’t know what you do and are coming to
            learn.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But how do you flip that around and reach out to people who know more than you? How do you approach somebody
            who is famous or influential or someone who’s extremely knowledgeable and provide value in a way that they
            can appreciate?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I’d say it’s just a matter of engaging with them. Twitter is one of the
            best things that’s happened to me as a business. I wouldn’t say it’s one of the best things that happened to
            the world, but it’s been good to me. I would basically just see who’s writing interesting things, follow
            them on Twitter, engage with them, ask them questions, share it, ask them deeper questions, eventually take
            it to email. If you’re at a conference, make sure to say “hi” to them and just engage in conversation there.
            People can tell if you’re trying to meet them because they’re someone, or if you’re genuinely adding value
            across the board.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And it’s hard in the internet world. There is so much noise. And one kind of mantra that I try to live by,
            and I don’t always succeed in it, but basically, trying to be a real and a nice person. Some people are
            like, “Oh, I’m just being real,” where really they’re just being an asshole. But instead actually not
            calling someone a “jerk” or not putting personal zings into a tweet to someone when you disagree with
            something that they wrote in a blogpost.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And maybe that’s very soft, but I think it actually does help you to connect with people, being a nice and
            helpful person to them.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Totally. And I know a lot of people who get a lot of email. I get a lot
            of email. And I think one of the things that I’ve noticed is that people, when they reach out to others,
            aren’t the best at understanding how to provide value and be useful. It’s almost always like, “Can you help
            me do my thing?”</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And one of my good friends now, Julian – he was actually on the podcast. I think he was episode number 17 or
            something. But he’s one of the few people who reached out to me early on when I was working on Indie
            Hackers. And he was like, “Hey, I see that you are starting a podcast, and I see that you’ve got sponsors.
            I’ve worked a lot with sponsors. Let me just give you some free tips on the best way to go about getting
            sponsorships and talk about how they look at things from their perspective.”</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And it was so useful and valuable to me, because he actually understood what challenges I was going through
            and anticipated those, and then gave me all this useful information that I wouldn’t have been able to find
            other otherwise. And it made me really want to help him however I could as well.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So going back to what you said, being able to provide value to somebody is such a great way to build a
            connection. And it’s pretty rare. It’s surprisingly rare that people take the effort to do that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, totally. And I think another thing there is emailing someone,
            basically asking them for their advice and not making a huge ask and expecting a huge thing back. But one
            thing that I like to do is email someone and be like, “Hey, I saw that you were talking about someone that’s
            pretty influential,” saying, “Hey, I saw that you were talking about such and such. I’ve been thinking about
            that for my business. Can I ask you a couple questions?”</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So then they’re basically opting into it. They’re like, “Yeah, sure. Send them over.” So you send them two,
            three questions that don’t require a super-long answer or a long-winded answer. People are super happy to do
            that. I’m always amazed at how helpful some of the most influential people I know are, just because they’re
            like “I’ve been through it. I’m happy to share, happy to help you get to the next level and learn from my

            CEO of a well-known company that, a couple years ago, I helped him out with something. From time to time
            I’ll see his name pop up in the news. I’d see them and be like, “Hey, I saw this. Good work,” and he’ll
            respond with a smiley face or something like that. It doesn’t even have to be a super deep connection. It’s
            not someone you’re emailing with on a daily basis or – he’s not a mentor of mine, but these are good
            relationships to have and they’re good, interesting people. So be a human and -</p>

            anyone worth emailing is probably somebody who’s very busy. If you can provide the necessary context for
            them to understand, and you can keep your email short, and you can ask questions that don’t require gigantic
            time investment on their part, then they’re much more likely to actually get back to you.</p>

            I think this skill set is also the skill set that you need to run a company. You need to be able to
            empathize with your customers and the costs that they’re going to have to pay to use your product. Similarly
            if you’re going to email somebody, you need to empathize with their situation and the costs it’s going to

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, ancient history. In Internet years, it’s basically a teenager
            now. It feels like it some days. I was working at an agency in New York City and I was doing some consulting
            on the side. And had gotten a promotion and my boss had left the company, so I had taken over some of those
            responsibilities. I had started doing some consulting while I was working at the agency because I needed a
            little bit of extra income. So I picked it up and was doing that evenings and weekends, and got to the point
            where I didn’t need that work. So decided that I wanted more time in my life.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I wanted more margin in my life. I was living in Brooklyn and was 28 years old, living in Brooklyn. I was
            single and spending a couple of weekends a month in my apartment by myself, doing work for clients for money
            that I didn’t need. So I was like, “You know what? I’m going to stop doing this.” Told my clients. They were
            like, “Who should we work with?” I was like, “Oh, I don’t know.” </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I had other people coming to me wanting to work with me. “Hey, I’m not taking on consulting.” “Well, who
            should we work with?” “I don’t know.” So I literally built out a Google Sheet of people that I knew in the
            industry that I trusted, and started referring work to them. I’d just email and be like, “I’m getting in all
            these leads. Can I refer work to you?” They were like, “Yeah, great. What do you need?” I just put together
            the budget levels they worked with, the size of their team, the types of services they offered, and then
            would introduce people to them. Then I realized that lead generation, it turns out, is a big business. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I got in a lead that was perfect for a buddy that runs an agency in Utah, that they’d just started up
            about six, eight, ten months before, something like that. I emailed him and was like, “Hey, man, I just got
            in this lead that I think is a great fit for you. Would you be willing to pay 50 bucks for it?” He was like,
            “Yeah, what’s your PayPal?”</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So three minutes later I had 50 bucks in my personal PayPal account. I sent him the intro and I went and
            bought a domain name and threw it up on some shared hosting that I had. It’s been bootstrapped and in the
            black since day one. But it was literally built out of a need where I wanted more time in my life, and had
            to solve the problem of I had people coming to me wanting me to do work for them, and I’m not doing work for
            them. So I didn’t just want to say “No,” I wanted to provide value there.</p>

            about helping?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It’s a great question. I honestly don’t know that I have a great answer
            for it. I’ve always, I think, been a helpful person and saw that these businesses had a very real need. They
            needed someone good.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            A couple of the people that came to me had been burned by bad SEO agencies. If you know anything about the
            SEO world, there are obviously the more visible people and there’s the Rand Fishkins and those people that
            are – even though Rand is not as in the SEO world as he used to be – but there are a lot of people that are
            quite well known.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But there’s also this super-seedy underbelly of the industry, which you get in some industries, but others
            you don’t. So I was tired of people hiring a bad agency, overseas or even domestically, that at best didn’t
            grow their traffic and their business kind of stayed steady, and at worst, hurt their traffic. They actually
            ended up wasting money and also their business got smaller and all of that. I kind of wanted to solve that
            problem.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it’s fascinating, as well, to be in an industry where trust and
            quality are big issues. It counts so much more to be a genuinely helpful, trustworthy person. It vastly
            increases the number of people who want to work with you, and increases sort of the surface area of your
            luck as well. Because when you have these people who you help, they want to help you. That’s in a lot of
            ways the essence of luck. People coming out of nowhere to help you out.</p>

            businesses. You mentioned Rand Fishkin. He’s one of the canonical examples of him creating Moz out of his
            consulting business. I think this happens in part because people spend so much time as consultants
            interacting with their clients and customers and companies that they end up unearthing these valuable
            problems that are worth solving.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Obviously, things don’t work out this way for everybody and some people end up never stumbling onto a good
            idea. So what do you think are some of the levers that people can pull on to unearth good ideas in the
            course of doing their normal job or their consulting work?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That’s a great, great question. The advice that’s often given is to
            solve your own problem. So that starts with identifying the problems that you have, and figuring out
            scalable ways to solve those. So let me talk about that a little bit more in detail.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What I do and what I like to tell people to do is, look at the things that you’re doing constantly. What are
            the things that you’re doing manually that you don’t have to do manually? Maybe this is – I think about it
            this way because I have a web development background and you probably think about it this way, where you’re
            like, “Wait, why am I doing this thing manually here?” I can store all of this information in this one place
            and click this one button and all of this information gets combined and gets emailed out to someone. I don’t
            have to copy-paste and put it into a compose window within my email and send it out. I can automate that
            stuff. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Basically what I’ve done is look for areas where I can streamline solutions to problems that I have. Making
            it more scalable that way. Then also seeing, is there a problem that somebody else has? So for me when I
            started Credo it was, I have all these leads coming to me and I need somewhere to send them. I also know
            that agencies are always looking to get not just more but also better and better-qualified leads. There was
            a need there and it’s something that people are willing to pay for. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I’ve come across so many – this is what most task (ph) businesses are, right? It’s something that people
            have been doing themselves, they’ve been doing manually and now there’s this tool, this company they can
            subscribe to or whatever, that’s going to help them do something better. It’s going to solve a problem that
            they have there. That’s one way that a lot of consultants and consulting companies can go into products,
            whether that’s info products or SaaS products or what have you. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But I will say that there’s a very, very real difference between running a consulting company and running a
            product company. It is night and day. There are things like customer support and development and sprint
            planning and whatever it is, all the things that go into building a product. You don’t do those in a
            consultancy or working directly with clients. It’s a very different sort of touch. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You have to figure out which one you’re better at and which one you enjoy more as well. Some people really
            enjoy going deep with clients and going on site with them, that sort of life. Other people enjoy the more
            scalable, having a lot of customers, all of them paying you a few dollars as opposed to having a few
            customers, everyone paying you a lot of money. They’re very, very different approaches.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I like what you said about solving your own problem and, in
            combination, making sure that other people have that problem as well, which was definitely the case for you.
            You had people asking for these referrals, and you also had to manage the spreadsheet yourself. That was
            also the case for Indie Hackers. I started Indie Hackers because I wanted to find examples of people
            starting these profitable businesses, and I was scouring the Internet trying to do it. Then I realized,
            other people are scouring the Internet too. I could see them leaving comments and see them talking about it
            online. So it was a problem that I had, and a problem that other people had. So I think that’s great advice
            and other people should follow it as well.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Let’s talk about you getting Credo off the ground, because another thing people struggle with is taking
            those first few steps. It’s very easy to overshoot and bite off way more than you can chew, at which point,
            you never really get version one of your product out the door. But with Credo you had the spreadsheet. You
            started off with the minimum viable product, and you charged your friend over PayPal without building much
            infrastructure at all. Where did you go from there? And were you ever worried about biting off more than you
            can chew and building some big, complex product?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I’ve definitely bitten off more than I can chew, so let’s not get
            confused about that. There’s definitely a lot that goes into it. Anyone that knows me will tell you that I
            put in a lot of hours. I don’t have to work the 90, 100 hour weeks now that I did at the beginning, but
            there were definitely those weeks at the beginning.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The way the narrative goes is, I got laid off end of September 2015 and said, “OK, I’m going to pick up some
            consulting to cover my bills.” I started working on the site. As you said, I had the Excel spreadsheet and
            had a web site up that was like, “Are you looking to hire an SEO agency? Get in touch with us and we’ll help
            you find one.” There were no public profiles or anything like that. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So the first thing I did was clean up the site, dusted off my code chops and got it back to at least
            something I wasn’t embarrassed to share, then figured out how to do public profiles on the site. Then did a
            launch on product time actually, in November of 2015. Got an initial spike in traffic and had some people
            coming in looking to hire. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            At that point, my business model was, I listed agencies and consultants on the site for free. I vetted them
            out by speaking with them on the phone and asking them for a couple of their clients. I could go look at
            SEMrush and tools like that to make sure the numbers were going in the right direction. Then I’d list them.
            Didn’t really have a monetization model that way. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Once they signed contracts, then I got paid a commission for a few months on that. It wasn’t a super – it’s
            not a scalable business model. It’s not one that I would recommend that anyone invest in long term, unless
            you’re the one actually selling the work, in which case you can take a cut. You’d also have more control
            over actually closing projects. But it got me started. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then from there I invested down in content marketing and started generating more leads. Then took a couple
            of months off of consulting to build out the first version of the Credo product, which was a marketplace
            where someone could come in and list their project. Eventually we built in an email system that would send
            the lead out, send the project out to consultants and agencies that were paying to be listed on the platform
            after they were vetted out, once again. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So no one’s listed unless they’ve been vetted out by me seeing a couple of their clients. Most of them I
            spoke with them on the phone. Even to this day, that’s how it is. I moved to this pure subscription model,
            simply because I was like, the lure of recurring revenue, which we all love in the Indie Hackers world. It
            worked and I went from – so in September of 2015, I did about $80 in revenue with the lead business. In
            December of that year, I did about $5,000. It had gone down to about $3,500 by that next April when I
            launched the membership site. I hit six figures in annual revenue, so $8,300-ish a month that September, so
            five months later. Then as I said, right now we’re around 20 to 25k.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think it was necessary. I don’t know that I could have done it in
            another way. There were so many different things to figure out. I think I probably could have done some more
            research and spoken with some more people that had tried to do this sort of business in the past, and
            learned from them and set myself up for success better. If I could go back, I would do that. I didn’t do a
            lot of it at the beginning.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But as I said, I was doing a lot of consulting and I was trying to get this business going. It was kind of
            necessary for me. If I could go back, yeah, the things I would change would be talking to a lot more
            mentors, doing a lot more research on the industry and on the business models that I should have had from
            the start. But sometimes you really do have to dig in, and it teaches you a lot. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            You’re doing a lot of things manually. I’m still a big fan of Paul Graham’s “do things that don’t scale.”
            But you can also only do things that don’t scale to an extent, right? Doing things that don’t scale gets you
            to a start, then you realize where the problems are and then you have to think creatively and build the
            solutions to those. So that’s how it went. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Would I do anything differently? In retrospect, hindsight is 20/20, right? There’s a bunch of things I would
            have done differently. Probably would have a co-founder. Would have started building a team earlier. But I
            don’t regret any of it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I do have a business coach that I’ve been working with for about a year
            and a half. I pay him monthly and we do a few calls a month. He’s helped me out a lot with revenue model
            optimization and product launches and that sort of thing. That’s something I would have prioritized earlier,
            though I didn’t necessarily have the revenue to hire a coach at that point. So it was mentors.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            There’s definitely a difference between coaches and mentors. A coach is someone that you pay, and a mentor
            is someone that they’re a bunch of steps ahead of you in their career, and they’re willing to give you a
            little bit of their time and share some knowledge with you. So I also have those, and those have been intros
            through friends. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Once again, just engaging with them online. I’m always super grateful when they give me some of their time
            and some of their direction. Those have been some of the more influential things. But then it’s also good to
            have someone there, in it with you, a coach. Those people that have co-founders, I think that’s really nice
            as well. Just someone else to be going through it with you and – four hands is better than two.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That’s definitely, definitely changed as the business has grown. I’ve been a lot better at reaching out to
            people and asking for help.</p>

            awesome answer. I think for a lot of people it’s a stroke of luck, and luck is hard to replicate.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The mentors I have were mostly introductions through friends. I was struggling with growing my business and,
            as I said, revenue was like 5K four months after launch, and then three months after that it was down,
            hadn’t grown at all and was actually down about 30%. I was just talking to a buddy. He was like, “You should
            talk to my friend Chris. I can do an email intro if he’s willing, and I bet he’d be willing to help on a
            call.” We did, and within about five minutes, Chris was like, “Wait, so you’re doing this and your business
            model is this? That’s completely wrong. This is how you should do it.” That’s why I launched the membership
            site and the subscription business model.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It was through talking to friends, talking to people that I trusted, and then they were willing to help me
            out. That’s how I got connected up with my mentors, just through connections like that. Then with a business
            coach, I’m running a bootstrapped business and came across this company called the Foundation, which helps
            people start and scale profitable businesses. One of the co-founders of that, Andy Drish, who is still my
            coach, he did the Bootstrapped Software Summit. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It was three days, eight interviews a day. The first one was like, people doing zero to 100k a year, people
            doing 100k to a million a year, then people that were doing seven figures a year in revenue. So he had it
            broken up like that. I discovered it one way and was like, “This is all I’m doing today.” Just watched all
            those interviews. Andy was interviewing people like Nathan Barry of ConvertKit, Dan Martel who thought of
            Clarity and a bunch of other sites. Some of them were Foundation students. A lot of them weren’t. I learned
            a ton. He provided a ton of value there. So I followed Andy, went to his blog and found some of the stuff he
            had been writing and subscribed to his email list. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            He has a smart email follow-up that I’ve implemented. It’s like, “Hey, Andy here. Curious why you
            subscribed. Hit reply and let me know.” Just straight-up, plain text. I responded and was like, “This is who
            I am and this is what I’m doing. This is why I subscribed, because I came across the Bootstrapped Web
            Summit.” He responds. He’s like, “I’m starting to do some consulting and really good at helping people go
            from 100k a year to 700k a year in revenue. Would you be interested in chatting?” </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I’m like, “Yeah, absolutely.” I was open to it and didn’t know where to go with my business. He’s helped me
            get to the next level. I found the person that is good at doing exactly what I was trying to do that was
            also two, three steps ahead of me in their career, in their entrepreneurship journey. Then just connected
            with them. Subscribed to their email list and started interacting with them and it led to him being my coach
            for the last 18 months.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">There are a couple. First one was when I first launched the membership
            site, it’s still a membership on the site to be listed and to receive work from me. Once again, after
            they’re vetted out. I initially had a self-serve model, and I had three different pricing models and people
            could sign up and – whenever you launch something, you get a couple early adopters and then it troughs and
            dies out a bit. It had done that, and I was getting people applying that weren’t necessarily a good fit.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I was like, “I should add some friction into here and make them apply. Then I’ll hop on the phone with
            them, and if you’re approved then I can send them how it works and send them a link to sign up.” I did that
            and the number of people applying jumped immediately. I actually got to have conversations with people,
            could figure out if someone was going to be a good fit. Then I also had their information and that
            relationship. I could follow up with them if they didn’t sign up, and make sure everything was going well.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So that was weirdly an inflection point. I added friction to the process of signing up and paying me. And it
            worked really well. Your mileage may vary with that tactic or with that strategy.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The other one was, I realized that jobs were not closing, jobs being submitted to the marketplace
            functionality weren’t really working. Those jobs weren’t closing with agencies. I decided to go back to the
            high-touch model of talking to people that are looking to hire someone and going deeper with them. “What are
            your needs? What’s important to you in an agency or consultant?” and that sort of thing. That’s also been
            another inflection point. With that, I raised my prices as well.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So I have fewer customers that I’m sending leads to actively, sending projects to actively. But they’re all
            much happier and my business is more profitable. And it doesn’t take a ton of time. I don’t have a hundred
            people paying me, expecting x number of leads or x amount of budget in new leads per month. It’s much fewer
            and I’m able to provide them a better service.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">In both of those cases, you weren’t afraid to add friction. You weren’t
            obsessed with scalability until you injected yourself into this process. In a way, it made you a bottleneck
            for sure. But also, because you’re charging a high enough price point, it didn’t really matter. You could
            still run a profitable operation.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            A lot of us, especially developers and product people, we’ve become obsessed with scalability. We end up
            adding feature after feature and lowering the price to something crazy, like $5 a month in hopes that we’ll
            make it up in numbers. That leads to all sort of customer support nightmares and scalability headaches.
            Often it’s better to charge more and then you don’t have to worry so much about scalability and you can
            provide better service to customers by being part of the experience yourself.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Totally. It definitely does help. I’m definitely still a bottleneck,
            but I think all founders are. When you create that margin in your business, it enables you to do great
            things like hire people that are better at things than you are. I think that’s a great point.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            No one ever built a million dollar company or a multi-million dollar company by charging people five dollars
            a month. Even the ones that might have that cheap starting tier, like Buffer. I think theirs is ten bucks a
            month, something like that. They may have raised that. But they have enterprise levels that I’m sure they
            charge a lot more. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            There’s more friction there, but it’s also because I’m adding a lot more value and people are willing to pay
            for that. Because of that, I don’t experience the churn that a low price SAS business that’s kind of a
            utility and something that’s not necessary for them to grow their business.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Absolutely. Credo is definitely a marketing first company, which is
            good in one way, in that you generate the audience, then you’re like, “What needs am I solving? What needs
            am I not solving?” Then you can move to that. But I will de-prioritize product development and that sort of
            thing. I de-prioritize design and all of that. That’s probably hurt my company. Like all founders, it’s your
            baby and you have hard time trusting people and hiring good people. That’s something that founders all deal
            with, and definitely something that I’ve dealt with as well. Hopefully gotten a bit better at it in the last

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Prioritization is tough. You talked about this when you talked about
            starting your consulting business, about how much better you needed to get at prioritizing in order to be
            able to run your business efficiently.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            A lot of people when they hear terms like time management, they think about how do they maximize the amount
            of time they spend working and minimize the amount of time they don’t spend working, the amount of time they
            spend distracted. But in reality they should be thinking about how to be more efficient with the time they
            do spend working, because there’s in any given time, an infinite number of things you can choose to do. Most
            of them aren’t that helpful. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Even among the things you can do for your business that are helpful, some of them are ten or a hundred or a
            thousand times more helpful than other things. So it’s not just about working more. More important than
            that, it’s working on the right things. How do you decide what the right things are to work on for Credo?

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Things that I like to work on? I wish I could spend all day writing.
            You (inaudible) learn marketing, but there’s a lot of operations stuff that has to happen. I’ve had
            different people in those roles, trying to backfill some of them so that I can focus on the things that I’m
            better at, doing better at customer development or persona development, figuring out what are the true needs
            of the people coming to the site. Who is our audience actually and what are they looking for?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            As you said, it’s very easy to get bogged down. One thing I’ve learned from, I believe it was the 4-Hour
            Workweek, or maybe something else that Tim Ferriss wrote, was I have a three times a day reminder on my
            calendar. It says, “Are you being productive or just busy?” Are you actually doing things that are going to
            move the business forward, or are you just doing things that you can do? Not that there’s anything wrong –
            you have to do those things, right? If your business isn’t going to go anywhere without doing them, you have
            to do it. </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But it reminds me to think, “Where do I want this business to go? Are the things that I’m working on the
            highest leverage things?” If not, and I’m not able to stop doing the things, and we can’t just overall as a
            business stop doing the things I’m currently working on, how do I hire someone else to do that so I can
            focus on the productive things? I can focus on the things that are going to move the business forward. It’s
            a constant sense check there.</p>

            things that I’m really good at. That’s the number one thing that’s keeping me from being able to grow at

            It’s that and it’s also, as I’ve alluded to, meeting the needs of the customers or the audience. Whether
            that’s – by the time this comes out, this will be launched. I’m launching a full time digital marketing jobs
            board, because people are always like, “Can you help me find a full time SEO manager?” I’m like, “I’m not a
            recruiter, right?” But people want to be able to advertise to an audience, like the 20,000 plus marketers I

            watch those YouTube videos. If they write blog posts, read those blog posts. Learn as much as you can, then
            reach out to them with specific questions. That’s how you get better at it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then you have to go out and implement it. There’s no substitute for hard work, unfortunately. It’s all about
            going out and chipping, as Peter Lovels likes to say, what are the five things that are going to move your
            business forward the best? Chipping, chipping, chipping, chipping and chipping. You have to keep on

            you should join me and a whole bunch of other founders on the <a href="http://indiehackers.com"
                class="linkified" target="_blank">IndieHackers.com</a> website. It’s a great place to get feedback on
            pretty much any problem or question that you might have while running your business.</p>

            As always, thanks so much for listening and I’ll see you next time.</p>
