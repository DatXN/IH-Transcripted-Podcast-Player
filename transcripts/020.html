                class="linkified" target="_blank">indiehackers.com</a>. On this podcast, I talk to the founders of
            profitable internet businesses, and I try to get a sense of what things were like in the early days,
            especially how they came up with their idea and the things they did to grow their businesses to where they
            are today. In today's episode, I am talking to Scott Keyes, the founder of a very interesting business
            called Scott's Cheap Flights. How's it going, Scott?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Thanks for coming on the show. It's great to have you. Scott's Cheap
            Flights is a mailing list for cheap flights. The way it works is that you, Scott, and your team of basically
            flight finders spend the better part of every day tracking down the cheapest deals on flights all over the
            Internet. As a subscriber, you get access of all of these deals in your inbox on a daily basis. We're
            talking things like $350 round trip airfare to Paris.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that's kind of it in a nutshell. We are people who are really
            obsessed with finding cheap flights. You know, some people really like cooking. Other people really like, I
            don't know, making Instagram videos. And for whatever reason, our obsession is literally just spending hours
            and hours and hours on Google Flights and Kayak and Orbitz and just trying to hunt down those cheap deals,
            almost like a treasure hunt. Then, when we find 'em, emailing 'em out to subscribers who want to know about
            these cheap flights and get them, the best deals, before they disappear.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think one of the coolest things about your story is that it kinda
            started as a personal obsession. It wasn't really a business from the beginning. In fact, you were just
            finding flights for yourself. This was back in 2015, a couple of years ago. Fast forward to today, it's
            transformed from this small mailing list that was really just for your friends and family into this 600,000
            subscriber behemoth that's generating $3,000 a month, which is almost $4 million on revenue. How did you
            make this transition, and how did you start Scott's Cheap Flights?</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That's exactly right. I never intended to start a business. I was never
            really an aspiring entrepreneur. But I love to travel. And I didn't have hardly any money in the bank. So I
            wanted to try to figure out a way to still travel without liquidating my life savings. So I got really good
            at figuring out those tips and tricks to get as cheap a flights as possible, got really good at navigating
            the frequent flier miles world.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then it all kind of culminated, in the middle of 2013, when I ended up finding and booking the best deal
            I've ever gotten in my life, which was nonstop from New York City to Milan for 130 bucks roundtrip. I didn't
            even know I wanted to go to Milan until I saw this deal. Who could say no to $130 round trip flight to
            Italy? Ended up going and, like, hanging out on Lake Como where George Clooney has a house there, like,
            hanging out, going skiing in the Alps, going and hiking in Cinque Terre. It was incredible. Then when I got
            back, that's when things changed because I was just hanging out in the break room at the office and people
            would come up and say, "Hey Scott, can you, like, I heard about that crazy flight that you got. Can you let
            me know next time you see something like that so I can get in on it, too?" Then I had enough people ask that
            of me that I started to realize, like, "Okay, I can't keep, try to remember every single person I was
            supposed to tell. Why don't I start a little email list, and that way I can just send it out to everybody at
            once?"</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">At first it was just a few dozen folks. I started a little free
            MailChimp list because first I was just gonna do it on Gmail, but then I realized, I think there's a limit
            in terms of how many carbon copies you can have on Gmail. I can't remember what it is, something like 25 or
            50 maybe. At least at the time it was not very high. So I started a little MailChip list and just kinda sent
            it out to my network, saying, like, "Hey, I'm doing this just for fun." And this is totally free, like, just
            a hobby, something I enjoyed doing. For, you know, like, a few dozen friends signed up the first day. And
            then, over the next 18 months, it just slowly started to grow out from that network. So then by the time of
            about April 2015, so just a little over two years ago, it had grown from that maybe initial 25, 50 people to
            about 3- or 400.</p>

            it doesn't just cover the US. We also cover flights departing Europe, flights departing Asia, Australia,
            Canada, Latin America, on down the line. We probably, as a company now, send out 15, 20 deal alerts each
            day. But at the time, I would send out, maybe I'd run across one or two a month. Because again, this was not
            even a side hustle because I wasn't getting any money for it. It was just a pure hobby. So it's just, like,
            you know, when I had some time, felt like going to search for some flights and, like, stumbled across
            something really great, then I would send it out. But it wasn't that much of a time suck initially just
            because it wasn't that big of a priority, at least in those initial hobby stages.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, so where things really sort of, like, the inflection point was
            April 2015. I'd been living down in Mexico and was getting ready to depart for a big two-month round the
            world trip with my now-fiancee. We'd basically amassed a bunch of frequent flier miles and were using them
            to get free flights all over the world. So we were going to 13 different countries, like, 20,000 miles, this
            big, big trip. I posted a little map on Facebook, just showing where I was gonna be going, something like
            for those doubters and haters of frequent flier miles, like, I am about to take this awesome trip for the
            next two months and it's all for free.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And just so happened, I was working as a journalist at the time. So I had friends working at other
            journalist outfits. And I had a friend of mine who worked at Business Insider, saw this and was, like, "Oh,
            that looks like an interesting story. Hey, Scott, can I pass this along to my friend here who writes about
            travel for Business Insider and see if she's interested in doing a story?" So, like, "Yeah, sure, by all
            means." So she was, and ended up doing an interview. The day we left for this big trip, the Business Insider
            article went up. It was with one of these sort of slightly click-baity, but made for viral headlines. You
            know, "Man travels round the world 20,000 miles, 21 flights, like, all for free, figures out how to game the
            airline industry." One of these that really gets people, a cross between, like, exciting travel, you know,
            frugal, the free part, all that stuff.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So it ended up going super viral, 250, 300 or 400,000 clicks on it. Like, literally over, you know, in that
            article it had a link to the email list. So literally overnight, it went from this just sleepy little hobby
            for 300, 400 people, 80% of whom I knew personally, to 5,000 subscribers, like overnight.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, it was. And I didn't really quite know what to make of it, a. And
            b, it was kind of one of those crisis-tunities, because the bad part was this little hobby that I enjoyed
            doing and enjoy doing with a free MailChimp list all of a sudden, email list is big enough that I was gonna
            have to start paying hosting fees. You know, I love doing this just as a hobby for friends, but I wasn't
            really thrilled about the idea of just paying money out of pocket for server space to do a favor for my
            friends. So that was the bad part.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The good part was, I sort of realized, "Hey, maybe there's more interest in this type of thing than I had
            realized." Like, all of a sudden there are 5,000 people who are really into this. I'm not a businessman by
            background or trade, but I knew enough about business and marketing to know that getting that first 1,000
            subscribers, those first 1,000 customers, is by far the most difficult thing to do.</p>

            nothing, like, not having to do any hustle, not take the time or anything. I was, like, "Man, maybe there's
            an actual opportunity for a business here." So it was during that trip that it then started to sort of
            percolate in my head, "Hey, how can I turn this into maybe a little business?" Throwing around some
            different revenue models in my head, like, ways to actually turn into a business. You know, "Should I do,
            like, a paid advertising thing? Should I do, like, a referral link type of thing? Should I do, like, a paid
            subscription?" Tossing all those around. Then, come August 2015, I ended up officially relaunching it as a
            business, went with the paid subscription model, and yeah, that was sort of the birth of Scott's Cheap
            Flights as a business, just about two years ago.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, that was kind of a crazy story. This is very early on, a couple
            months after officially launched as a business, and it was starting to grow enough and have enough customers
            and have enough work going on that I realized, like, I need some help. Like, I can't do this by myself. Just
            around that time where I was starting to think, like, "Man, how am I gonna find somebody as a business
            partner, someone to take on responsibility with this," Brian reached out to me because he was doing a
            giveaway.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Basically he was trying to start a travel blog, travel community thing and figured, "Maybe I can give away a
            couple subscriptions to Scott's Cheap Flights and do an interview with him." So we chatted for a while, gave
            it a couple subscriptions. And I just got a really good vibe from talking with him, like, "Man, this guy,
            he's got his shit together, like, he seems pretty hardworking, entrepreneurial. Like, I'm just impressed
            with the cut of his jib." So kind of on a lark, I just him, like, "Hey, look, this may sound kind of weird,
            but we kind of need help over here. Things are growing, we've got customers, but it's just more work than we
            have. Like, there's a lot of opportunity to help build this up. But yeah, is that something that you're
            interested in?" He said yes, we worked it out, and it ended up being just such, again going back to
            serendipity.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's probably not a wise or advisable business partner search strategy to just take somebody who you
            randomly met on the internet and be, like, "Hey, you wanna go into business together?" And we'd never even
            actually met face to face until about five months ago or so. But I just, again, got so lucky because not
            only is he incredibly competent, incredibly skilled and hardworking, but also our skillsets really
            complement one another as well. I'm obviously good at the flight searching stuff and then good at, like,
            writing with the journalism background. Then he is really good at that behind-the-scenes back end stuff,
            like a lot of building systems, trying to get partnerships worked out, trying to build up marketing and
            development growth, all sorts of stuff like that behind the scenes that's hard to put a singular label on.
            But, I mean, Scott's Cheap Flights wouldn't be a 10th of what it is today if we hadn't had that
            serendipitous meeting and decided to go into business together.</p>

            </span>
        </header>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, initially we set the free and premium model. The thinking was, I
            was very, coming from a journalism world, I was very cognizant of the difficulties that a lot of newspapers
            went through going from their websites where they offered older articles for free to then trying to charge
            for it. I know how difficult it is to have a categorical shift in people's mind from trying to start
            charging them for things that they used to get for free. So I was very, tried to stay mindful of that.
            That's why I was, like, "I don't wanna just have a purely paid list and tell everyone, like, 'Hey, starting
            in August 2015, you have to pay for this. If you don't, then take a hike.'" That was part of the thinking.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Another part of the thinking, which ended up working out really well, was that if we have this free list, a,
            it's a lot and it's a massively lower barrier of entry for new subscribers. It, like, asking someone just to
            sign up for an email list is a way smaller than asking them, someone who'd never heard of Scott's Cheap
            Flights, to come in and pay for it. But even more than that, than having this built-in list of free
            subscribers, wound up creating a captive audience where any time we, like, when we send out deals to the
            free list, it includes little banners, like, "Hey, just FYI, free subscribers missed out on, like, I don't
            know, $350 deals to Rome yesterday" or something like that. Like, "Sign up for premium here to get all of
            the deals." Those types of things. And we have these folks who are interested, already know how Scott's
            Cheap Flights works, and are much, much much easier to convert to paying subscribers than just random Joe
            Schmo who just found out about Scott's Cheap Flights yesterday.</p>

            Obviously, once we hit certain thresholds, we have to upgrade server space and stuff like that. But for any
            given subscriber, it's effectively zero. But we found that, over time, just about 10 to 12% or so of free
            subscribers wind up becoming paid subscribers. That is incredibly lucrative then. If we can just sign up 10,
            convince 10 people to sign up for the free list, we know at least one of those people are gonna wind up
            paying for it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah. We actually even recommend people that they don't sign up for
            premium right away. Like, I want people to sign up for the free list initially. We actually, on our website,
            when you come in, there's only one call to action. It's just, put in your email address. After you do that,
            then there's information about like, the premium list, you know, if they're really interested right away.
            But I want folks to start out on the free list 'cause I want them to get a sense of how Scott's Cheap
            Flights operates and make sure that it's what they're looking for, make sure that they don't have a
            preconceived notion about what it is that it doesn't ultimately end up being.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Some people think it's like Groupon, where we have this block of flights that we're selling ourselves, some
            people think it's like Kayak, where they can search for the flight themselves. Some people think it's like
            Flystein, where they can have an expert go look up the best flights for them. And Scott's Cheap Flights
            isn't any of those things. It's something new and different. So having people come in and see for the first
            week or two, just get the free deals, see what it's all about and then decide, "Okay, am I interested in
            getting more of the perks? Am I interested in getting all of the deals rather than just some of them?" The
            difference between the premium and the free list is, all the deals go to the premium list, whereas just one
            out of every three go to the free list.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            All the premium list gets to choose which specific cities you want departure alerts for. Say, like, you live
            in New York. You say, "I only want flights departing JFK, La Guardia and Newark," or maybe you can add in
            Philadelphia and Boston in there too, if you really want, or Hartford. But you get to choose which specific
            ones, whereas for folks on the free list, they choose by region. So they say, like, "I just want deals
            departing the Northeast," or "I just want deals departing the West Coast" or something like that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">If evolved a little bit over time. The one out of every three has been
            that way the entire time. Premium subscribers get a deal, like, when a deal goes to the free list, premium
            subscribers get it 30 minutes before the free subscribers, which for some deals doesn't matter. But for some
            deals, they legitimately only last a couple hours at times. So finding out about it early can sometimes make
            the difference. There's no ads in the premium emails. That's also been there since the beginning.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The two premium features that have changed since the beginning are that, like I said, that specific airport
            selection feature that I mentioned and we now offer text message alerts, as well. But that's only for
            premium subscribers, as well. Those are things that we just didn't have, like, the functionality built out
            initially. But it's something we do have now. We ended up taking away one feature. Initially, when the
            premium list was a lot smaller, well, the entire list was a lot smaller, we offered free credit card
            consultations for premium subscribers. Going back, I got really good at frequent flier miles, generating
            them and using them for best value. A big part of that is which specific airline or points credit cards to
            open. I'd say, like, "Okay, yeah, if you're a premium subscriber and you're thinking about opening up a new
            credit card, send me an email, I'll help you choose." That went along great for the first six months or a
            year or so. But then it just ended up getting big enough that I was just every day having dozens--</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Yeah, I was on MailChimp initially. I had a website that I just
            actually, my brother was good at web design. So he just kind of built out a website initially. MailChip that
            we used FormCraft initially, which was just a form plugin thing that connected well between the website and
            Stripe, which we use for payment processing. That was, like, the initial stack setup. We ended up over time
            phasing out form crafts once we got the new website built with our own form capture and then just connected
            directly to Stripe still for payment processing.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We did PayPal for a while. We offered that as a payment option. Ended up taking it out because it just
            didn't, without getting too wonky about it, it doesn't play nearly as nice with other apps and plugins. It
            ended up being, I'll just take one specific point here. When folks would pay with PayPal, it would
            automatically use whatever email address they had as their PayPal email as the email that they signed up for
            the list with, like for the Cheap Flights email list. But a lot of times, people didn't want that. They
            wanted a different one. So it would cause problems. Like, they didn't realize that and so they wouldn't be
            getting emails for weeks, and were, like, "Where are my emails?" And, like, "Oh, it went to the one that you
            signed up with." Ended up just being big headaches trying to figure it out with everybody.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So yeah, we ended up phasing out PayPal as an option, oh gosh, six months ago or so. We go back and forth on
            whether or not to bring it back. But I think we're all kind of happy to not have it, even though it's, like,
            slightly, we probably sacrifice just a marginal amount of revenue by not offering it. We, I think, are,
            like, amount of hassle and headache that we save by not doing it is by far worth it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That was really where it started to get professionalized. The first few
            months were really just almost a test to figure out, "Okay, I've been doing this thing for free. Got a bunch
            of potential people. Are people willing to pay for this? Is this something that I could even cover my
            hosting costs with," which at that time, I think, were $50 a month. I just initially wanted to set a really
            low price point. We said, like, "Is this something that I can convince 25 people to sign up for two bucks a
            month? Like, can I do that?" Even the first day or two wasn't really clear if I'd hit it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But then it started to pick up. I think by the end of the first month, had 100 or 120 paying subscribers at
            two bucks a month. So I was very happy. I was making money, like, it was profitable. You're already turning
            a profit the very first month. But again, when it had grown to 10,000, 15,000, you know, by the time that I
            brought Brian on, we really realized, "A, there's a lot of potential here." Most people who are signing up
            are really happy. There was no churn at the time. Expenses were next to nothing. We don't have an office
            space. There's no physical product, like, it cost basically nothing to scale. And user satisfaction was
            really high.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So we just started to put our heads together. Like, "What types of tactics can we take to try to get things
            as good as possible?" He came up with a bunch of really, I think, smart ideas. I'll give you a few examples.
            We shifted away from the $2 per month model to, I think initially, the price was five bucks for three
            months, 15 for six months and 29 for, I'd have to double check to make sure that's what it was initially. It
            was something like that, five, 15, 29 for three months, six months or 12 month subscription. It basically
            was about the same price, in some cases even a little bit lower than two bucks a month. But by not
            processing payments every single month and instead of processing them, like, once a year, once every six
            months or once every three months, we ended up saving a ton on credit card processing fees because the way
            it works is, like, standard processing fee is something like 2.9% plus 30 cents. And that 30 cents out of
            two bucks is more than 10%. So we were getting eaten every transaction somewhere between 15, 20%.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So just by shifting to a longer payment structure, we ended up making and saving a ton of money. So that was
            A. B came with ideas about, like, a Black Friday sale and raising prices. We ended up raising prices right
            around new year, I believe.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">After a few months. Yeah, I mean, that was right around when Brian came
            in and we shifted to this longer term structure, realized, "There's a potential to raise prices here." But
            there's always a little bit of a fear when you raise prices, like, are people gonna revolt? Are we
            undermining ourselves? So we did two things.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The first thing we did is, we kept everybody grandfathered at whatever rate that they signed up at. You
            signed up at two bucks a month, you can stay at that for life. And we still have some subscribers on the
            list who are paying two bucks a month. We had people who signed up, say, 15 bucks every six months, like,
            they're still at that. We are by no way affecting existing customers and so negate any chance of revolt,
            people canceling because of that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The other thing that I realized from this was just a real surprise for me, is how much of a sales booster
            raising prices can be. That's because, again, because we had this grandfather clause, the result was that
            people realized, "Oh shit, if I don't sign up by the deadline tomorrow, prices are going up." It takes
            everybody who's, all these 10,000 people who are on the free list and are sitting on the fence deciding,
            "Should I upgrade or not?" It all of a sudden forces them to make a decision, and make a decision that's
            weighted in our favor because they realize, "Either I can do it today at 19 bucks or I can do it tomorrow at
            29 bucks." So the sales just skyrocket in the day or two leading up to that deadline.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            That's made me much less averse to price increases where they're warranted, because I know that when that
            happens, it's gonna drive a ton of upgrades in the time leading up to it.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The last insight, I think, just tangible example I can think of that Brian really came up with and executed
            really well was that he went back and did some analytical data crunching on existing users. He found that
            basically, he noticed an interesting little quirk. When someone signs up, there's a decent change that
            they're upgrade right away and there's a decent chance they'll upgrade in the first month. Even that first
            to second month, there's somewhat of a chance that they'll become paying subscriber. But almost nobody on
            the free list who had been on there for more than two months was upgrading. Like, it was a very, very small
            number.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So what we realized from that is, okay, these people have a very low chance of upgrading and ostensibly are
            not, like, high value because of that low chance of upgrading. So what if we can offer them something to try
            to entice them to upgrade?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            What we did was, we offered them a free month. We'd segment the list. We would say, "I only want people on
            this list who have been on for more than two months, on the free list, who have not upgraded." And we sent
            them all just a free upgrade thing. It said, "Hey, for the next couple days, you can try out the premium
            list for free for one month. You gotta put in your credit card and stuff, it won't get charged for a month
            if you cancel it. Cancel any time, no questions asked, in that month, you won't get charged. Even if you
            forget, 'It just got charged, I forgot, it's two days later. Can you cancel and refund?' Yeah, absolutely."
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But we found that something like, we would get 1,000s and 1,000s of upgrades just from this, again, from
            this group that had almost no chance of upgrading to begin with. It was leading to 10s of 1,000s,
            50,000-plus in revenue that was just free money because it wasn't gonna happen naturally. That was, again,
            just a tangible, really insightful thing that Brian noticed and implemented and one of the reasons why I'm
            so grateful to have him on the team.</p>

            model, the fact that we don't have a big ask, just, "Hey, sign up, it's free. Try it out," and that's the
            one call to action. So a lot of the webpage right now is optimized for that type of thing. Again, there's
            one call to action, just put in your email address. There's, like, an opt in. You're going to leave, like,
            "Hey, just put in your email address real quick." A lot of that is optimized for collecting email addresses.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            A lot of growth through Reddit. We've been posted a lot on Reddit Entrepreneur, on Reddit doing AMAs, stuff
            like that, that has led to a ton of subscribers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Tons of media hits. You can always see a decent spike when there's a good article in Washington Post or
            Conde Nast Traveler, stuff like that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            But honestly, the biggest source of growth, we did a survey recently of subscribers, 45% of people said they
            found out about Scott's Cheap Flights via word of mouth. Almost half of people came because some friend of
            theirs had told them, like, "Hey, you should sign up for this." A, that's extremely flattering that it's
            something that people really recommend to their friends and that it's gotten so much growth that way. But B,
            it's been an interesting data point as we have gone back and forth about whether or not do to a referral

            We keep going back and forth on it because on the one hand, people like referral programs. They work. It
            helps bring in new customers. On the other hand, if 45% of our people are already coming in, 1,000s, 1,000s,
            1,000s a month are coming because they heard about it from friends--</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Oh yeah, no, I'm a super skeptical guy. I almost never pay for
            something right off the bat. I wanna try it out. I wanna see if I like it. And there are plenty of things
            that I've tried out, liked a little, liked, and then decided, "Yeah, I'll pay for this." I'll give you a
            real quick example, Slack. Once the team started growing big enough, we couldn't just use hangouts as our
            messaging service, 'cause there was no group aspect to it. Like, it was all just one-on-one conversations.
        </p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So we ended up moving over to Slack. But then, you get above 10,000 messages, it stops archiving, all these
            other things. We decided, like, "Yeah, this is actually pretty valuable. We've been using this, we really
            like it. Yeah, we'll pay 50 or 100 bucks a month, whatever, whatever it costs nowadays," and are really
            happy having done so. That, I think, is the model, I think nowadays. It just makes so much sense to let
            people try something out, see if they like it, and then figure out if it's worth paying for or not.</p>

            gonna be able to convince to pay for. But that's fine, because again, the marginal cost for every free
            subscriber's basically nothing. But we wouldn't be able to get those 10 to 15%, wouldn't get nearly that
            many folks, if we didn't have the free list for people to try it out first.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I think another cool thing about your business is that typically, it's
            pretty hard to get consumers to pay for things. Like, if you sell to businesses, businesses are making a lot
            of money and so there's a lot of opportunities to help them make more money, or to help them save money. So
            it's easier for them to do the calculation in their head of, like, "Of course I'll pay for this product
            because it's gonna help me make money or save money." But with consumers, it's a little bit harder to get
            that point across. I think that Scott's Cheap Flights is in this interesting area where, like, consumers
            spend a lot of money on travel and on airline tickets. If you can save people 100s of dollars on that, then
            it's a no-brainer.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Well, it's also just a very unique industry. It's not like, I don't
            know, buying an iPhone where the price is basically always the same, you know exactly where to get it, like,
            the price is gonna be the same today as it will be next week, you know what to expect. It's just one single
            product. Whereas with flights, I mean, literally the price is changing by the hour if not more.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Who has any idea what it's supposed to cost on any given route between, like, what's a flight supposed to
            cost between, like, D.C. and Sapporo or something? I don't know. I mean, I do know because I spend my day
            doing this type of thing. But for most subscribers, I think you could tell them $900 or you could tell them
            $1,900 and they would, like, "Yeah, you know, I guess that's probably what's right." Whatever Kayak spits
            back at you as the price, like, there's not always a good reference point for folks to know, like, "Is this
            a good price? Is this a bad price? Should I be buying it now? I wanna travel in three months. Should I pull
            the trigger now, should I wait?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's a super opaque industry, that almost every single person on any give flight is paying a different price
            than the neighbor sitting next to them. Almost positioning ourselves as this sort of concierge or decoder in
            the middle to tell folks not only to be your advocate and searching, like, "Hey, here's a really good deal."
            We're always looking for them, but also that we can tell you what's not a good deal, when you should book
            it, how long we think it's gonna last, that type of thing.</p>

            Whereas every other site that I've been to is everything. I talk to people in the Indie Hackers home about
            this a lot. Like, there's so much of a temptation when you start a business to spread into all these
            adjacencies and do all these related things. But if you just focus on one thing, then you can do what you
            guys have done and streamline your home page so you only have one single call to action and you can increase

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Everybody does different types of things. We have folks who do customer
            support. We get somewhere between 300 and 600 emails a day in the inbox, so they're helping folks out. We
            decided very early on to basically do no paid advertising, but instead take that budget and focus it on
            customer support.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I wanted people when they email in, to not have to wait the standard 24 to 48 hours to get a response. I
            wanted to get our response in a couple hours, if not a couple minutes, because I think that type of
            interaction, especially with a new company that you don't know are they trustworthy, is this good, is this
            bad? If you get a response back within minutes of emailing, that's a really positive interaction that you
            have with the company, especially answer your question, help you out.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think, like, bringing on, really investing in customer support was something I was really, really glad
            that we did early on, especially given the nature of the business, that because it's so email-based, any
            time somebody has a question, they just email it back. Like, they're not always gonna take the time to look
            on our FAQ on the website or anything like that. They're just, like, "Why am I gonna look there? Let me just
            email 'em back." So putting that emphasis on customer support folks was important.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            We have some folks who are doing flight searching as well. I used to be the only one doing flight searching
            for US and Canda. Now I've got a few folks helping out with that as well. Then we've got folks doing the
            flight searching for Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Latin America. We have some folk, we have a social
            media manger, some folks doing web development, doing sort of the techie side of things. Yeah, it's kind of
            all over the map now, like a bunch of different roles. But one of the cool things is that everybody is
            based, everybody works remotely. We're in 10 different countries around the world.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I mean, I don't wanna say never say never. I'm just highly skeptical of
            the efficacy of ads. Like, I don't think, I think it's just something that nowadays, who likes to feel like
            they're getting sold something? People like to feel like they found out about something on their own,
            whether it's word of mouth, whether it's doing their research, that type of thing. I tend to think that the
            budget can be put to much better use in terms of customer acquisition, better than paid advertising.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think there are slight exceptions to that. Like, the fact that Facebook, with their boosts, lets you
            engage more either with your own audience or like-minded audience, we started to dabble very minimal, you
            know, 10 bucks here, 15 bucks there, in terms of boosting a couple stories or posts that we'll put up. But
            I'd have trouble envisioning us ever having a four-figure, five-figure ad budget or anything like that,
            because I just… don't. I tend not to see that as not the best way to get, like, not the most effective way
            to get new subscribers.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I'll give you an example. I think, for instance, that money is better spent, if I had $1,000, I would not
            spend that on $1,000's worth of ads. I would do a giveaway and say, "Two free flights to Europe for you and
            your friend." This is something we've done before. When we do this, we'll get 30, 40, 50,000 new subscribers
            just because we, like, not only from doing a giveaway but also from doing a giveaway that is effectively
            tailored to promote social sharing. So you get, like, one entry for putting in your email address but you
            get five entries for every person who subscribes with your referral link, or not subscribes, enters the
            giveaway with your referral link.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">That's such a smart idea. It's cool because I see a lot of companies do
            giveaways, and the thing that they're giving away is so unrelated to their product. Like, if you give away
            free flights and it's, like, anyone who enters that competition cares a lot about it is also going to enjoy
            Scott's Cheap Flights because they like cheap flights.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">We just never had to. Been lucky enough that we never, you know, we've

            and our expenses are just so low that we'd never had any need.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Not only that but obviously, as I'm sure your listeners are well aware, as flattering, and it is extremely
            flattering to be approached by investors and funders, obviously you're never getting money with no strings
            attached. You're giving up equity, you're giving up some control. And then you're shifting from being your
            own boss, the one making all the decision, to all of a sudden having to be accountable and answer to someone
            else, as well. That's a big mindset shift.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Like, we can do with the company what we want right now. We can either try to maximize profit or we can
            reinvest everything. We can try to focus on user acquisition or just improving the user experience. We can
            take things in whatever direction we want and not have to be maximally focused on returns in the way that
            you might have to be if you have an angel investor who's kinda breathing down your neck. So yeah, again,
            very, very humbling, very flattering to be approached, but you know, super fortunate position to be able to
            say no to it.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">I will preface this with saying, it is really hard to think long term
            because if you told me a year ago that we would be 10 times larger than we were then, I would have said
            you're flippin' crazy. It's hard to even, I think there's very little chance that we're 10 times bigger a
            year from today. But who knows. I guess it's possible, who knows?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So (a), it's a little bit hard to envision it. But (b), it's because it's hard almost to visualize, like,
            "Who would I be with six million subscribers rather than 600,000?"</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            It's a little bit hard to make long-term plans. We've almost kinda eschewed doing any type of super
            long-term planning. We've mostly stuck to short-term and middle and medium-term planning, kinda thinking
            three to six months ahead, like, what types of new features, what types of new outreach methods and stuff do
            we wanna pursue?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            The main thing, I think, that we'd like to do, obviously without giving away too, too much of our plans, but
            the main thing that we really wanna do is improve the user experience. Right now, we're still kind of
            running on an MVP with some of the new systems in terms of premium subscribers choosing their departure
            airports and. We really wanna kinda build out a system that's much more user friendly, that's much more
            intuitive and much more visually pleasing for folks to be when they're setting up their account and getting
            that type of stuff.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            And then just start to explore more types of outreach opportunities, whether that's building a blog,
            whether, again, we keep going back and forth on this possible referral program, even starting to, for
            instance, we sent out an email the other day, asking for folks, saying, like, "Have you gotten any really
            good deals on Scott's Cheap Flights and have a cool story with it?" We get people emailing us all the time
            about, "Oh, we took our honeymoon that we didn't think we could afford," or, like, "I visited this relative
            back in Europe who I hadn't seen for 10 years, 'cause prices were too expensive." Do you have any cool
            stories like that?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            So we got 100s and 100s of stories and people were sending photographs and stuff, these, like, really
            touching, heart warming stories. So we started to post those a little bit on Facebook, but trying to figure
            out, you know, is there more ways we can focus to engage people with those types of stories, you know,
            sharing those types of successes?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Then we also have folks who are traveling all the time, like, thousands, tens of thousands of people taking
            these cheap flights who are taking photos, having experiences. Is there a way that we can start to tap into
            their experiences, have people be, like, "Oh, snap, when you're in Barcelona, you go to this really awesome
            hole in the wall restaurant," or if you're in Venice, like, "Here's the best way to, I don't know, hail a
            gondola" or something like that, and start to harness some of that user-generated content into something
            that we can share with everybody and build a little bit more of a community or a little bit of a knowledge
            base.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">It's a couple things. First of all, to a certain extent, it doesn't
            always have to be a choice. We can be doing giveaways and be doing Reddit and be trying to gin up on media
            and stuff like that. But you're right to the extent that you do have to focus your efforts somewhat and try
            to decide, on any given day, are we gonna try to do this or that?</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            Part of it is, we try to recognize the unescapable gravity of diminishing returns, that yes, we've had some
            really successful viral posts on Reddit. But if we try to do that every day, every week, or even every
            month, not only would it stop working but we would take all the goodwill that we've earned on Reddit and
            folks telling each other to subscribe, recommending it to other Redditers, stuff like that, and it would
            turn it instantly into bad will because they'd be, like, "This company is just on here, they're just
            advertising. They're just in it for themselves rather than trying to help people," stuff like that.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            I think the same type of thing happens with giveaways to a certain extent. If you have it every week or
            every month, it stops becoming special. People just sort of start to tune it out. So we try to mix it up,
            try to figure out different types of areas.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            One of the things that's made things much more complicated these days is the fact now that we're not just in
            the US and Canada. I cover flights departing Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia. So that's trying to
            think about ways to grow larger in those types of markets can also get difficult because it's just a whole
            different ball game.</p>
        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">
            For instance, with the giveaways, I didn't realize this, but each country's laws regarding giveaways are
            vastly, vastly different. Sometimes they're as little as, like, in Canada if you do a giveaway, I think in
            the province of Quebec, you have to also post the language of the giveaway in French. In some places like, I
            think in France, if you're doing a giveaway, you have to reimburse people for either the postage or, like,
            the internet cost that it took them to enter your contest. Like, there are all these...</p>

            those waters a bit because it can be really fruitful if you pull it off well. But it's not as simple as just
            taking what's worked in the US and then applying it to Australia or to the UK or anything like that.</p>

        <p class="episode-transcript__paragraph">Got it. Well, we are running towards the end of our hour. I think your
            story is super interesting and hopefully it'll inspire other people who might not be programmers or might
            not be career entrepreneurs to get out there and do something valuable and start from nothing and build a
            successful business as you have. Thanks so much for coming on the show, Scott.</p>
